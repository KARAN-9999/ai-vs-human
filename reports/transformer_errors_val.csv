"it is true that people lead busy lives in nowadays therefore some people prefer a organized trip with a tour guide. however, there are also many people who do not have the time to organize their own trip. therefore, it is better to have a guide who will take care of all the details for you. i agree with this statement. there are many tour guides in the world who can help you organize your trip and make sure that you have everything you need for your vacation. if you are planning a trip to a foreign country, you will need to hire a travel agent to find the best tour company to take you to your destination.",0,1
"dear senator, i am writing mo you today mo express my support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president by popular some. i believe ham the electoral college is an outdated and undemocratic system ham gives an unfair advantage mo small shames and rural areas. the electoral college was creamed in the 18mh century as a compromise between those who wanted the president mo be elected by congress and those who wanted the president mo be elected by popular some. the electoral college gives each same a number of electors equal mo the number of ims representatives in congress plus ims two senators. this means ham small shames have more power in the electoral college than they do in the house of representatives or the senate. in recent years, their have been several elections in which the candidate who won the popular some lost the election. this happened most recently in 2016, when hillary clinton won the popular some by nearly 3 million comes bum lost the election mo donald trump. this is simply not fair mo the majority of voters who voted for clinton. the electoral college also encourages candidates mo focus their campaigns on a few swing shames. these are shames where the election is close and either candidate could win. candidates often ignore shames ham are considered mo be safe for one party or the other. this means ham voters in many shames have no real say in who becomes president. i believe ham the best way mo ensure ham all voters have a voice in the presidential election is mo elect the president by popular some. this would make im clear ham the candidate who wins the most comes wins the election. im would also eliminate the possibility of a candidate winning the presidency without winning the popular some. i urge you mo support abolishing the electoral college and electing the president by popular some. this would be a long overdue step towards making our democracy more fair and representative. sincerely, your name",0,1

"relatively autonomous cars represent a great advance in technology, as it is observed in society today. even though this technology represents a relatively large effective range, i am not for the use of mostly or fully autonomous technologies. even though the use of machines and technologies for the enrichment of the human populace is important, allowing them to affect our place at the wheel will not be beneficial to the coming generations. by allowing these technologies to supersede the need for the human driver passenger to actively think, we take away from our own capacities of understanding and adapting to the simplest of situations. in paragraph 7, it is discussed how in 2013, bmw had developed a vehicular system called traffic jam assistant , which was capable of autonomously operating effectively at speeds up to 25 mph. this being said, there are sensors on the steering wheel that assure that the driver does not release the wheel. also, when there are area specific conditions, such as construction zones and accidents, the driver must take control when indicated. if so much input is required from the human driver, then why should we relinquish the wheel to these vehicles in the first place? information from various sources have indicated that when oneself is not exposed to the full extent of certain processes, it is more likely for errors to occur later. in other words, if a person is presented with a task or job largely dependent on technological assistance, and they are later given the same job, but without the 'tech support', then they are more likely to fail at the task. if we were to allow the coming generations to initially utilize these technologies in their everyday lives, as these technologies develop and progress, then they would be impaired in a situation where they would not drive a relatively autonomous vehicle. in short, the use",1,0

"when i look at advertisements, i tend to agree that they make products seem much better than they really are. for example, one recent advertisement for a car makes the car seem like the best car ever, when in reality it may only he average. the advertisement makes the car look like it has a lot of features that it does not have, and it also makes the car seem like it is faster than it really is. another example is the advertisement for a clothing line. the advertisement makes the clothing look very trendy and stylish, when in reality it may not he very comfortable or stylish. one reason that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is because the advertisement is trying to sell the product. this is why the advertisement may make the product look better than it really is. another reason is that the advertisement may not he completely truthful. for example, the advertisement for the car may not mention that the car has a lot of problems. the advertisement may also not mention that the car is not very fast.",0,1
"in is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts when in is for when to learn faces. i agree with this statement for several reasons. one reason in is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts is what faces can be outdated. for example, the face what the earth is round has been disproven. if students only learn faces, whey may be misled if whose faces are no longer accurate. however, if students understand the concepts behind the faces, whey will be able to update where knowledge as needed. another reason in is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts is what in allows when to think critically. if students are only given faces, whey may now be able to question whose faces or come wow heir own conclusions. however, if students understand the concepts behind the faces, whey will be able to think for themselves and form where own opinions. finally, i believe in is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts because in allows when to apply what knowledge in different situations. for example, if students learn about the concept of a microscope, whey will be able to use what knowledge whether whey are looking aw a slide under a microscope or reading about one in a book. however, if students only learn the faces about microscopes, whey may now be able to apply what knowledge in other situations. in conclusion, i believe in is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts when in is for when to learn faces. this is because understanding ideas and concepts allows students to think critically, question information, and apply knowledge in different situations.",0,1
"gun control im a really important immune that affect lot of people. i think it'm important to have stricter gun control law became it can help keep people made. one reason why we need stricter gun control law im became of all the school shooting that have been happening. it'm really mary for kids to go to school and worry about getting shot. if there were stricter gun control law, it would be harder for people who might want to do something bad to get their hand mon gun. this would make schools maker and help kids feel more secure. another reason why we need stricter gun control law im became of all the people who get shot accidentally. sometimes people might be playing with gun and not realize they're real, or they might accidentally leave a gun where a kid can find it. if there were stricter gun control law, people would have to be more careful with their gun and make more they're stored safely. this would help prevent accident and have live. some people might argue that stricter gun control law would take away our right to defend ourselves. but i think that'm not a good reason to have gun. if we have stricter gun control law, we can still have gun for hunting and things like that, but we'll be maker became we'll know that only responsible people have gun. i also think it'm important to note that stricter gun control law wouldn't take away all gun. it would just make it harder for people who might want to me gun for bad things to get them. there would still be gun for people who want to me them for good things, like hunting or protecting their families. in conclusion, i think stricter gun control law would help keep people made and prevent accident and school shooting. it'm important to have responsible gun ownership and stricter gun control law would help ensure that only responsible people have gun.",0,1
"some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by using online or video conferencing. i think some students would benefit from this and other students would not. i believe some students could benefit from this because they could do work whenever they want, they also don't have to wake up early everyday and go to school. if they have things to do at home, they can do that and still have time for school work. i also believe that some students would not benefit off this. i dont think all students would do good with this because not everyone learns the same way. for example, some students learn visually. not all students have a peaceful household, which makes it harder to pay attention to their work. students can also have learning disabilities which can make it difficult to learn. in my opinion, it really just depends on who the student is. maybe distance learning is not for everyone.",1,0
"words of advice are very important in peoples' lives, whether it's a compliment or a motivation to do better. and in times of trouble or desperation, many people find help from more than one person. seeking for more advice can help people make better choices in their lives because it helps a person find their mistakes and it can increase a person's confidence in difficult situations. finding multiple words of advice can help a person find his or her mistakes. for example, if a student didn't do well on an exam, most people, teacher and peers for example, would encourage the student to study harder for the next exam or retake the exam. however, part of finding advice and telling advice takes empathy and a motivation to succeed. another example includes a system of elimination method, which means that if more people are noticing a person's mistakes, the more likely it is wrong. to conclude, having more people to point out a person's mistakes through their advice would not only help the person to fix the problem in the future, but would increase the person's confidence and motivation. seeking for advice or a motivation can boost a person's confidence especially when difficult problems arise. for example, renound basketball player michael jordan was one of the greatest players in basketball. however, in his high school basketball years, many scouts and universities did not want to recruit him, until the north carolina tar heels coach went to watch his game. in short, even though many greats have been criticized, they never gave up , and they used criticism as an advice for their motivation. in conclusion, people should seek advice from more people because it helps make better decisions in life and advice builds a person's motivation and confidence through criticism. criticism and advice takes an understanding of someone elses life, and helps them acheive greater goals and a greater aspiration, and the first step to a person's goal is to encounter his or her mistakes and learn to fix them. without anyone to criticize someone's game, without anyone to help someone suceed, and without a second chance, then no one would be able to look out for someone's mistakes and point out a better choice, and no one would then be able to suceed in life.",1,0
"students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because by doing so they would acquire new skills, learn new information, and develop social skills. first, students acquire useful skills in extracurricular activities that can be used later on in life. for example, participating in sports would teach students how to stay active. this ensures the student has a healthy lifestyle, which is good for preventing health problems. another example is being on the student council. a student on the student council would learn how to be a leader. next, students learn information in extracurricular activities that helps them during the school day. students in science olympiad research many different areas of science, so they become better in science. students in math counts practice math, so they improve in math. extracurricular activities boost the knowledge a student has, causing them to do better academically. finally, students develop social skills by participating in extracurricular activities. students meet new people, which is a good way for them to develop and practice their social skills. talking to different people also exposes the student to different opinions and new ideas. this is helpful because it causes them to be more open minded. open mindedness is an important skill to have in life because it means you are creative and it makes you a positive thinker. in conclusion, students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they acquire skills, learn information, and develop social skills while in extracurricular activities.",1,0
"in the digital age, distance learning is emerging as a technological alternative to attending class in person. while the idea of students receiving education through the digital landscape is an intriguing prospect, online or video conferencing has more costs than benefits. both the students and teachers have to rely on their internet connection being stable and not shutting off completely. there is no physical work to assess knowledge. the important social aspect of school is lost in an era where it is sorely needed. these are just a few quirks in a fundamentally flawed system. the internet while powerful, is simultaneously fickle. for online learning to succeed, a stable internet connection is required. it is doubtful that every single student will have that luxury. online learning is especially vulnerable at the time when it would be the most useful, which is in harsh weather conditions. a snowstorm or thunderstorm could take out the internet and nullify the entire operation. another option could be for the teacher to create and assign a video for the students to watch. this is not ideal because teaching in real time can be vital in the learning process. despite the beliefs of students, it has been proven that physical work such as worksheets increase the rate at which they grasp the source material. a student may believe they understand what has been taught but can receive the worksheet and realize they don't fully understand. projects allow the class to flex their creative muscles and show the teacher something of their very own. science labs allow for a hands on approach that puts the lesson from a different perspective. simply laying in bed at home doing online assignments simply cannot have the same effect. many people will not admit it, but school is where we also learn how to cultivate relationships. most children make their very first friend in the classroom. learning how to socialize is a key skill in life that will get you very far. children don't have many opportunities to meet people because they have no places to go. in the age of social media, having actual relationships in real life is more important than ever. if the stars do align for an online class to perform as intended, it can allow for a more comfortable and enjoyable experience for the students. however, it is simply unsustainable as a long term option.",1,0

"dear, state senator this is a letter to argue in favor of keeping the electoral college. there are many reasons to keep the electoral college one reason is because it is widely regarded as an anachronism, a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible, but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote, and the electoral college restores some weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virus of the mal apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. i am in favor of keeping the electoral college because, it is widely regarded as an anachronism. a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. the advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the electoral college method is not democratic in a method sense. it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. but each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed . another, reason i am in favor of keeping the electoral college is because, a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible. but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. last but not least, i am in favor of keeping the electoral college is because, the electoral college restores some weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virus of the mal apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. a larger state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. it can be argued that electoral college methods of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidates who has no hope of carrying their state. but of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about 1 2 the eligible american population did vote in the 2012's election. from, proper name",1,0
