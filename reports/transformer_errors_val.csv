"i think the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom isn't valuable. i say it isn't valuable because like it says in paragraph 5 that the computer tells what kind of mood you're in. that's kind of weird don't you think? i don't know maybe its just me. i just believe that people should get the chose to tell you how they feel on their own if they would like you to know how they feel. paragraph 6 it states that the computer can recognize iv a student is becoming confused or bored with the activity that he or she is doing, i think that's popping someone's bubble, honestly. the facs can be cool at certain part in live, but only iv the person that you are using it on would like you to know their mood. in paragraph 3 it says that the facial action coding system has six basic emotions. those emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, are, and sadness. iv i found out that the computer was reading what my emotions were i'd be a little aired, surprised, and the emotion that they don't have... weird. i'd be weirded out a little when they told me that a computer would be telling me how i feel. i don't know about you guys, but i personally like to keep to myself. furthermore, i don't like to be the center of attention or wanting anyone thinking that i need attention. this is why i believe that the facial action coding system is not a good idea to have to express how children in a classroom feels.",1,1,0.9809396322398117

"the face on mars has been said to be created by many things. some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars. paragraph 5 other people believe that it is a natural landform. it could have been aliens, but we have yet to find life on mars. the reason that makes the most sense as to why its there is that it is indeed a natural landform. sure the land may look like a face, but it is simply a natural landform. it is possible that other lifeforms were on this planet at some point, but it does not mean that it was created by them. landforms like these occur here on earth too. they are common around the american west. these are called buttes or mesas, and buttes are simply a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. paragraph 12 this landform even reminds people of the middle butte in the snake river plain of idaho. these two are roughly the same height. the pictures of this mesa has changed over the years. in 1976, it strongly resembled a face. in 1998, it didn't appear as humanlike as it did in 1976. and lastly in 2001, it must looks like a simple mesa, no face, no alien markings. i do realize that it might make sense to you and other people that it could be made by aliens. but we have yet to find actual life on mars, let alone have it be made by nonexistent creatures. this obzect may seem extraordinary, but it is simply must a mesa on a planet we haven't even found running water on. i would love to say yes, this was actually made by aliens! but sadly i cannot because it is simply must a landform. therefore, it could not have been created by aliens because these landforms appear on earth. it looks similar to landforms on earth. it also has been photographed many times over the years with better cameras each time. scientist can gladly say this is only a landform, in fact these also appear on earth as mesas or buttes. in conclusion, this is must a natural landform that was not created by otherworldly beings on mars.",1,1,0.9909165615690746

"the facial action coding system facs is an innovative approach to understanding human expressions and their underlying muscle movements. developed by dr. paul ekman and his team at the university of california, facs has been instrumental in providing a comprehensive framework for analyzing human emotions. the facial action coding system categorizes facial expressions into distinct action units aus , allowing researchers and psychologists to identify, analyze, and compare different facial expressions across cultures. each au represents a specific muscle movement or facial action, and there are currently 43 aus in the system. by breaking down facial expressions into smaller components, the facial action coding system helps us better understand human emotions and their universality. it has also been utilized in various fields, such as psychology, filmmaking, and law enforcement, to identify emotions and detect deception. in psychology, facs is used to study nonverbal communication and emotions. by observing and categorizing facial expressions into their component actions, researchers can analyze and compare different emotional expressions across individuals and cultures, helping to understand the underlying emotions and their universality. in the filmmaking industry, facs is utilized in creating realistic and convincing facial animations for animated characters or for actors in motion capture suits. by understanding the muscle movements and facial expressions associated with specific emotions, animators can replicate realistic emotional expressions in their animated characters. in law enforcement, facs can help investigators detect deception and emotions during interviews and interrogations. officers are trained to identify microexpressions, subtle facial expressions that can indicate deception or hidden emotions. by understanding and categorizing these facial actions, officers can more effectively analyze and interpret suspect behavior. in conclusion, the facial action coding system has significantly contributed to our understanding of human emotions and facial expressions. its categorization of distinct actions and their underlying muscle movements provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing and comparing emotions across cultures. by utilizing facs in various fields, researchers and professionals are able to gain valuable insights into nonverbal communication and emotions, ultimately improving our ability to interpret human emotions and expressions.",0,0,1.0611979343003614e-05

"it seems that nowadays people spend less time outdoors than before. i believe that one of the reasons for this is the widespread use of cell phones. while staying indoors may seem more convenient, spending time outdoors can actually be much more enjoyable. there are many activities that can be done outdoors, such as playing sports, practicing sports, jogging, and exercising. many people find outdoor activities enjoyable because they can do them with others and enjoy the weather while doing them. it's important to make an effort to go outside more often. if people don't engage in outdoor activities, they risk developing weak bones later in life. there are plenty of ways to stay active while still enjoying the outdoors. for example, if you don't enjoy sports or jogging, you could try riding a bike. biking can be a great way to get some exercise and fresh air, and it can also help to strengthen your bones. another great way to spend time outdoors is by playing outdoor games. games like tag, freeze tag, and hide and seek tag are not only fun, but they can also improve your stamina and strength. the best time to go outside is when the weather is nice and when you have nothing else to do. and if you're going outside alone, don't hesitate to join a local park or community center to meet new people and participate in group activities. in conclusion, it's important for people, especially children, to spend more time outdoors. there are plenty of ways to stay active and have fun while enjoying the great outdoors. so, put down your phone, step outside, and start exploring the world around you!",0,0,0.2085339047522189
"a four day school week with each day lasting ten hours may seem to be an appealing option, as it has potential advantages and disadvantages for students, teachers, and school staff. for students, it would give them more free time in their week to pursue hobbies or focus on individual research projects. it could also allow teachers more flexibility to plan ahead and their teaching approach, as well as the ability to cover more material in a certain amount of time. however, it could be difficult to accommodate certain classes that require in person student participation, such as science experiments or exercises within a physical classroom setting. on the other hand, for school staff, a four day school week with ten hours per day could mean working more hours within those days. depending on the school's other services, such as extracurricular activities and on site care, this could mean added demands that would be outside of traditional school hours. whether this is an attainable option depends on the resources the school has available to provide these services and support staff. in conclusion, a four day school week with ten hours per day could be a feasible option for your school depending on a variety of factors. it has potential advantages and disadvantages for students and teachers, as well as considerations for the school staff and resources available.",0,0,0.0006620848984714246

"the electoral college is a unique voting system that is a part of the united states' presidential election process. the system was established in the u.s. constitution as a means to elect the president and vice president of the united states. the electoral college works by allocating a certain number of electoral votes to each state based on its number of representatives in congress and the number of senators, with the exception being the district of columbia which has three electoral votes. in this system, each state's electoral votes are then distributed based on the winner of the popular vote within the state. the candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes becomes the winner. this process ensures that smaller states with a lower population are still given a significant say in the election outcome. one potential criticism of the electoral college is that its structure can lead to an outcome where the popular vote winner does not become the president. this happened in the 2016 presidential election, where hillary clinton won the popular vote by nearly three million votes, but donald trump won the electoral college vote, making him the president. another criticism is that the electoral college can give disproportionate power to swing states, which can lead to candidates focusing on only a few states instead of campaigning nationwide. in conclusion, the electoral college is a system designed to ensure that smaller states have a voice in the presidential election. however, it has its flaws, as it can lead to a candidate winning without the popular vote, and potentially giving too much power to swing states. despite these issues, it remains a part of the united states' presidential election process, and it is important for citizens to understand its function and potential limitations.",0,0,0.0015402684338825944
"the example of bogot , colombia, shows us how a day without cars can have a positive impact on our community. by leaving their cars at home and opting for alternative transportation, citizens of bogot were able to reduce air pollution and stress, while also promoting physical activity and social interaction. the initiative, which has been observed for three consecutive years, has not only benefited the environment but also transformed the city's landscape and lifestyle. the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most in latin america, has encouraged residents to use eco friendly transportation, such as biking and skating. this, in turn, has led to reduced traffic congestion, improved sidewalks, and the development of new parks and sports centers. moreover, the day without cars has set an example for other cities to follow. the participation of cali and valledupar, two other colombian cities, and the interest shown by international municipal authorities, such as enrique riera, mayor of asunci n, paraguay, demonstrate the initiative's potential to inspire positive change globally. furthermore, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. according to a study by the world health organization, air pollution costs the global economy billions of dollars each year. by reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease air pollution and its associated health costs. additionally, promoting alternative transportation can boost local businesses, as people are more likely to shop and dine in their neighborhoods when they don't have to worry about traffic and parking. however, some people may argue that limiting car usage would inconvenience them and disrupt their daily routines. but, with proper planning and investment in alternative transportation infrastructure, we can make it easier and safer for people to use eco friendly modes of transportation. for instance, dedicating more lanes to public transportation, improving bike lanes, and investing in electric or hybrid buses can encourage more people to leave their cars behind. in conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous benefits for our community, our environment, and our economy. the example of bogot shows us that it's possible to make a positive change by promoting alternative transportation and reducing air pollution. by following their lead and investing in eco friendly infrastructure, we can create a healthier, more sustainable, and more livable city for everyone.",0,0,0.0007085288910220755

"the facial action coding system facs is a universally recognized and extensively researched method to analyze, categorize, and understand human facial expressions and their underlying muscular actions. developed by dr. paul ekman and dr. wallace friesen in the 1970s, facs has become an essential component in numerous fields, including psychology, psychiatry, law enforcement, and even computer animation. at its core, facs is a system that breaks down human facial movements into 43 distinct facial actions. each action is assigned a unique number or code, allowing researchers and practitioners to accurately identify and describe the various facial movements associated with emotions, thoughts, and expressions. the importance of facs lies in its ability to provide a common language for understanding and interpreting facial expressions. this language is crucial in cross cultural studies, as facial expressions can vary greatly across different cultural contexts. facs allows researchers to standardize and compare facial movements regardless of the participant's cultural background. facs has also proven to be an invaluable tool in law enforcement. by analyzing a criminal's facial movements, investigators can better understand their intentions, emotions, and potentially uncover crucial details about a crime. in addition, facs has been instrumental in the development of realistic, emotional facial movements and expressions in computer generated characters in movies, television shows, and video games. in summary, facial action coding system is a groundbreaking method that offers a universal language to analyze, categorize, and comprehend human facial expressions and their underlying muscular actions. its widespread application in various fields has made it an essential tool in understanding human behavior, aiding law enforcement investigations, and creating more lifelike computer generated characters.",0,0,2.311718362858771e-06

"car free cities are an intriguing idea that has gained traction among urban planners, environmentalists, and city dwellers alike. imagine a city without the hustle and bustle of cars, where people can move around freely on foot, bicycles, or public transportation. while the concept might seem utopian, there are real life examples that showcase its potential. one of the primary reasons behind car free cities is the reduction of air pollution caused by automobiles. in areas where cars are the primary mode of transportation, they emit large amounts of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter, which contribute to climate change and negatively affect human health. by minimizing or eliminating cars in cities, these harmful emissions can be significantly reduced. another significant advantage is the promotion of physical activity. car free cities encourage people to walk or bike instead of driving. this leads to increased fitness levels, reduced healthcare costs, and a more active lifestyle. additionally, it fosters social interaction, as people often encounter others on their commutes, creating a sense of community. public transportation becomes more efficient in car free cities. with fewer automobiles on the streets, buses and trains experience shorter travel times and less congestion, leading to better reliability and more accessible services for the general public. car free cities can also contribute to urban planning and city design. the absence of cars allows planners to focus on creating pedestrian friendly environments, incorporating green spaces, and prioritizing public amenities like parks, plazas, and bike lanes. this, in turn, encourages a more sustainable and pleasant living experience for residents. while car free cities might sound idealistic, they do have some limitations. one significant drawback is the potential reduction in mobility, particularly for individuals living far outside the city center or those who need to travel long distances. additionally, car free cities might not be feasible for all communities, as they rely on the availability and accessibility of alternative modes of transportation. in conclusion, car free cities offer an intriguing vision for the future of urban living, providing numerous benefits such as cleaner air, increased physical activity, improved public transportation, and better designed city spaces. however, they also present challenges related to mobility and accessibility for some residents. as we strive towards a more sustainable future, it's essential to carefully consider the potential implications of car free cities and continue exploring innovative ways to reduce our reliance on automobiles.",0,0,0.0008930732244536442

"a large majority of the population has a smart phone or some other devise like it. a lot of these people think they cannot live without their phone being on their person. this causes people to be distracted while driving, and causing crashes. they do have other things they can use like the hands free in their cars. they also have the very high possibility of being pulled over and given a ticket by police. all these are more than enough reason to stop driving with a phone. in america 28 of the crashes happen because of a phone using distracted driver. this is freighting to me because all it takes is one person on their phone to crash into someone else and possibly take their life. this is a danger to anyone and their vehicle on the roadways making people unconfident while driving. motorcyclist also have an even greater danger as they are harder to see even for non distracted drivers so the danger is multiplied. in 2019 most cars on the road have a hands free devise built in to the car. this helps many people not use their phone and keep his or her eyes on the road. a lot of people that text and drive may not even know such a thing exists, but if they use this then they will greatly reduce the chance of a fatal crash. a lot of states now have laws against having your phone in your hand while driving at all now. you will run the risk of getting pulled over and receiving a ticket with a large fine from them. i am glade that they do this as it makes people think twice before picking up their phone for an unnecessary text and causing an accident. people need to realize that other people's lives are not less important than their phones. in conclusion i believe that people should not be able to use their phones in the car. using the phone can cause you to be distracted and lose control of your car. there are safer ways of going about this like use the cars hands free systems. and finally the fact that you could be given a ticket should make you think twice before using your phone. there is just too much at risk to be driving distracted.",1,1,0.9999946581714195
"there are a number of reasons why younger people may enjoy life more than older people do. one reason is that young people are more likely to be in good health than older people. according to the centers for disease control and prevention, people over the age of 65 are more likely to have at least one chronic condition, such as heart disease, diabetes, or arthritis. young people are also more likely to be physically active and to eat a healthy diet. another reason why young people may enjoy life more than older people is that they are more likely to have a positive outlook on life. a study by the university of california at san diego found that people who are optimistic are more likely to be happy and to enjoy life more than people who are pessimistic. young people are more likely to be optimistic than older people, because they have not had as much experience with disappointment and failure. a third reason why young people may enjoy life more than older people is that they are more likely to have a strong social network. a study by the university of michigan found that people who have strong social ties are more likely to be happy and to enjoy life more than people who do not have strong social ties. young people are more likely to have strong social ties than older people, because they are more likely to be in school or in the workforce, and to have a large group of friends. there are a number of reasons why young people may enjoy life more than older people do. one reason is that young people are more likely to be in good health than older people. another reason is that young people are more likely to have a positive outlook on life. a third reason is that young people are more likely to have a strong social network.",0,0,0.0015849096204045233

"the summer break is a time that students and educators eagerly anticipate. while some argue that the break should be year round, with a 3 4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall, i believe that a longer summer break is the best option. students need more time to relax and recharge, and a shorter break would not give them enough time to do so. one of the main reasons for this is that students often come from different countries and need to return home for a visit. for example, an exchange student from vietnam may come to the united states with their parents for an emergency, but their siblings still live in vietnam because they were married before signing up. the summer break is the only time that allows the student to go back to their country and visit their family. additionally, many students work part time during the summer to save money for their future needs, such as buying a car or going to college. the part time work that students do during the school year is helpful but not enough to prepare for their future expenses. a longer summer break would give them more time to work and save money. furthermore, students need a break from their studies to relax and recharge. they don't want to be thinking about homework and deadlines while on vacation. teachers may give homework during the break for no reason, which can be stressful for students. some teachers also put too much pressure on students by giving them big projects and homework assignments that they have to finish before the break ends. this is unfair to students, who didn't expect to be graded during their vacation. in conclusion, a longer summer break is the best option for students. it allows them to relax, recharge, and spend time with their families. it also gives them more time to work and save money for their future needs. a shorter break would not give them enough time to do all of these things, and would be unfair to students.",0,0,0.1397912845518923

"climate change is a serious issue that has been affecting our planet for many years. it is caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. the effects of climate change are already being felt around the world, with rising temperatures, more frequent natural disasters, and the extinction of many species. in this essay, i will argue that governments should take immediate action to address climate change. firstly, climate change is a global problem that requires a collective effort. no single country can solve this issue on its own. governments need to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit the damage caused by climate change. this can be achieved through international agreements such as the paris agreement, which aims to limit global warming to below 2 degrees celsius. secondly, climate change has a significant impact on the economy. extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods can cause billions of dollars in damage. the cost of repairing infrastructure and providing aid to affected communities can be enormous. by taking action to address climate change, governments can reduce the risk of these events occurring and save money in the long run. thirdly, climate change has a direct impact on our health. rising temperatures can lead to heat stroke and other heat related illnesses, while air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels can cause respiratory problems. by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, governments can improve air quality and protect public health. finally, taking action on climate change is our responsibility as citizens of the world. we have a duty to protect our planet for future generations. by reducing our carbon footprint and supporting policies that address climate change, we can make a positive impact on the environment. in conclusion, governments should take immediate action to address climate change. the issue is too important to ignore, and the consequences of inaction are too severe. by working together, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect public health, and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.",0,0,5.3177341052974435e-06
"dear teacher name, the debate in weather we should all be required to complete community service or not is a big decision to make. in my opinion we all should be required to have done some community service because it not only helps our community but it helps the students grow as people in society. this could be a chance for students to feel like they can make a big difference in such a little way. also some students already perform community service on a daily basis and don't even know it. this could be a chance to show them what a big help they are as well as congratulate those students who do know they do community service on a daily basis. i think that community service can be a lot of fun if we know that we are doing it to help others and ourselves. this is a project that not only a few students can be incorporated with but the whole school can take part. another great reason to include community service in our program at school is because it looks great on our high school transcript and for colleges to look at. this could help a lot of our students succeed in careers of there future and even making it into colleges of there choice. some examples of community service projects that the school could perform are tutoring, cleaning up the liter around school and on the sidewalks around town, raising money for a foundation or group in need, or even having a big brother program. these simple acts can make a huge difference in someone's life especially if they are in need of some care or just need someone there with them. i feel like when and if we do this we could have a great outcome in the attitudes of the students. when you make this decision i encourage you to think about the great things that could come out of putting community service into the program. i deeply feel it could help many students. and i hope you can put that into consideration when you make the decision to put it in or not. many students would be delighted to know that you are looking out for there futures by having them help other thank you for the time you took to read this letter and hear my opinion on the situation. sincerely, student",1,1,0.9966972847729929

"it honk students should have a b average on order to participate on sports or other activities. it honk this because students grades should be more important then participating on sports and activities. furthermore, i also think this because this well help students keep their grades up of they do want to participate on something that the school has to offer. my last reason for agreeing with this os that of this os a possible policy change ot well encourage athletic and students who participate on activities, to be concerned about their grades and keep them up. a students grades on school should be the main concern more than them being on a sport or activity. tho's policy change well encourage those students to focus on their grades as well as the activity they are involved on, or would like to be involved on. students should not have a problem with this policy change of they are that passionate to take on sports and activities. if this os changed as a new school policy the students grades well be hofer and more focused on then just the sport or activity they want to be on. tho's new change could help benefit students a great deal who have grades lower than a b average. it could help them on school by keeping their grades up and making them care more about their education. tho's could also help students with poor grades who do not try hard on class but may be passionate about a sport and well want to be on that team and well make them put forth effort and try harder on class. tho's could also benefit them by keeping them out of summer school or having to repeat a grade level. most of the students who want to participate on activities well pay more attention to their school grades and keep them up to an a or b average. the new change well help parents be more attentive of their son or daughter's grades on school. tho scan also help parents to be more involved on the helping of their child's study habit's. in conclusion o believe that students should have to maintain a b average on order to participate on sports and activities. tho's should be a policy change for the school on order to help students with their grades.",1,1,0.9998639773407361
"education is a crucial aspect of our lives that helps us acquire knowledge and skills to navigate through the complexities of the world. while some people believe that education is only important during the formative years of our lives, i strongly disagree with this view. in my opinion, education is a lifelong process that contributes to our personal growth and development. one of the main reasons why education is a lifelong process is that it helps us adapt to changes in the world around us. technology, for instance, is advancing at an unprecedented pace, and it is essential that we keep up with the latest developments. continuous learning enables us to stay relevant in our careers and adapt to changing job requirements. in this way, education is not just a means to an end but a lifelong pursuit that enriches our lives. furthermore, education helps us broaden our horizons and develop a more nuanced understanding of the world. as we continue learning, we encounter new ideas, perspectives, and ways of thinking that challenge our existing beliefs. engaging with diverse viewpoints expands our horizons and enables us to become more tolerant and empathetic individuals. finally, education is an essential tool for personal growth and development. it helps us become more informed about the world and ourselves, which can lead to greater self awareness and personal fulfillment. education can help us develop critical thinking skills, which enable us to evaluate information objectively and make informed decisions. it can also help us develop emotional intelligence, which is essential for building meaningful relationships and achieving personal success. in conclusion, i strongly believe that education is a lifelong process that contributes to our personal growth and development. learning does not stop when we finish school or university it is a continuous journey that enriches our lives and enables us to adapt to changing circumstances. therefore, it is essential that we prioritize education and make it a fundamental aspect of our lives.",0,0,9.93553121131782e-08
"the facial action coding system facs is a widely utilized method of analyzing human facial expressions. it was developed by dr. paul ekman, a renowned psychologist and pioneer in the field of emotions and facial expression, and his colleagues in the late 1970s. the system categorizes and identifies distinct facial movements associated with various emotions. facs is comprised of 43 action units aus , which are basic facial movements that contribute to a particular emotion. these action units are grouped under 12 major categories, including 1. eyebrow raising 2. eyes closing or squinting 3. eyes opening or widening 4. nose wrinkling or flaring 5. lip corner pulling or tearing 6. lip pressing 7. lip corner pulling or tearing 8. lip pressing 9. lip puckering 10. lower lip raising 11. chin raise or lowering 12. head tilting by analyzing these action units, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of human emotions and their underlying facial expressions. the facs has been extensively utilized in various fields, such as psychology, cinema, and even law enforcement. in the context of law enforcement, the system is used to identify suspects' facial expressions during interrogations and to help detect deceit. furthermore, the facs has also played a significant role in the development of facial recognition technology, which has become increasingly prevalent in various industries, including security, advertising, and social media. in conclusion, the facial action coding system is a crucial tool for comprehending human emotions and their associated facial expressions. it has numerous applications in various fields and continues to be a valuable resource for researchers and professionals alike, as they strive to understand the complex nature of human emotions and their expression.",0,0,0.00015246063299662898

"technology is a fast growing resource in the work today and the availability of such is quickly rising. in many schnooks, technology is becoming an important aspect of every day life. not only does technology enable students to keep up with classwork outside school and on days they do not attend but it also allows for more flexibility. if the technology that students use every day had the ability to determine how they feet about certain lessons, then not only would it benefits them but it would benefit teachers as week. technology that can determine someone's emotions was once thought to be a thing of the future but now that future is here. professor thomas huang has been able to create a computer algorithm that determines human emotions by scanning their facial expressions. imagine the possibilities with such software!! the most beneficial area in which the computer algorithm could be used in is schools. ' a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, ... then it could modify the lesson, kike an effective human instructor. ' huang, paragraph 6 not only would teachers be alerted when students were becoming distracted from their teachings, but they would also be offered suggestions on how to improve the lessons. software such as the type that dr. huang has created could improve test scores across the nation and ease the workload of thousands of teachers. why not use it? hence, forth, technology that determines human emotions would be largely beneficial and effective for a large portion of the works population. schools would experience the most positive results from the software seeing as it would be able to adjust lessons to fit students learning curve and it would also reduce teachers workloads by creating lessons to fit students needs. the only negative aspect of dr. huang's software would be the cost of installation, but with the positive outcomes that would follow, whatever cost paid would be week worth it.",1,1,0.9584011686686774
"the future is now. with the development of the facial action coding system, computers can now identify human emotions. but is this a useful application of technology? should this system be used in a classroom setting? in this essay, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom, and ultimately decide whether it is a valuable use of technology or not. the use of the facial action coding system in the classroom would give teachers access to a powerful tool. by being able to read the emotional expressions of their students, teachers would be able to tailor their lessons to better meet the needs of their students. for example, if a teacher were to see that a student was confused or frustrated, they could tate the time to clarify the lesson or provide additional resources to help the student understand the material. however, there are also some potential drawbacks to this technology. one of the main concerns is privacy. the facial action coding system would essentially give teachers the ability to read the emotional expressions of their students at all times. this could potentially lead to violations of privacy, as a teacher could potentially use this technology to spy on their students or to collect data on them without their consent. in addition, this technology could potentially be used to discriminate against students. for example, if a teacher were to see that a student was feeling anxious or stressed, they could potentially use this information to unfairly judge the student or to target them for bullying. in conclusion, the use of the facial action coding system in the classroom is a complex issue with many pros and cons. while the technology could potentially provide teachers with valuable information that could be used to tailor lessons to the needs of their students, there are also potential privacy and discrimination concerns that need to be carefully considered. ultimately, the decision of whether to use this technology in the classroom should be made by weighing the pros and cons and considering the potential impact on students, teachers, and the overall learning environment.",0,0,0.0012298063861227212

"making mona lisa smile is an article that talks about a new technology called the facial action coding system. this technology allows computers to identify human emotions by analyzing facial expressions. while this technology may have some benefits, i do not believe that it should be used to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. firstly, the idea of using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom raises concerns about privacy. students should be able to express their emotions freely without being monitored by a computer. it is not ethical to invade their privacy by using technology to read their emotions. secondly, emotions can be complex and varied, and a computer may not accurately interpret them. for example, a student may be smiling, but that does not necessarily mean they are happy. they could be smiling out of politeness or to cover up their true emotions. a computer may not be able to distinguish between genuine and fake expressions, which could lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations. lastly, the use of this technology could create a negative learning environment. if students know that their emotions are being monitored, they may feel uncomfortable and less likely to express themselves freely. this could lead to a lack of participation in class activities and discussions, which would hinder their learning experience. in conclusion, while the facial action coding system may have some benefits, it should not be used to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. it raises concerns about privacy, accuracy, and could create a negative learning environment. instead, teachers should focus on creating a safe and supportive environment where students feel comfortable expressing their emotions freely.",0,0,0.002431605358743832
"fame comes with both advantages and disadvantages, and one od the most common disadvantages is the lack od privacy. some people argue that famous people should be given more privacy and that the media should not be so intrusive, while others argue that this is the price od their dame. i disagree with the latter perspective and believe that famous people should be given more privacy. first od all, famous people are still human and have the same right to privacy as everyone else. they should not be treated differently just because they are in the public eye. the media should respect their basic right to privacy and not intrude on their personal lives. for example, paparazzi should not be allowed to follow them around and take picture sod them without their consent. furthermore, the media can be too intrusive and sensationalize stories about famous people. this can lead to under and inaccurate portrayal sod famous people and can be damaging to their reputation. for example, some tabloids have been known to publish false stories about celebrities, which can lead to public humiliation and distress. finally, famous people should be given more privacy because it can help them to maintain a healthy worksite balance. constant media scrutiny can be overwhelming and can lead to burnout. it is important for famous people to have some time away from the public eye so that they can relax and recharge. in conclusion, i believe that famous people should be given more privacy. they have the same right to privacy as everyone else and should not be treated differently just because they are in the public eye. furthermore, the media can be too intrusive and sensationalize stories about famous people, which can lead to under and inaccurate portrayals. finally, it is important for famous people to have some time away from the public eye so that they can relax and recharge.",0,0,6.169830003479473e-05
"the election by popular votes for the president of the united states is what i'm am arguing for. having a president by the people who vote for him her will make everyone happy make everyone more comfortable. having this argument is being done for all the people that agree with me. we as american citizens should have a say so in who we chose as president. good president, bad president. either way, we should decide. it's only fair. if we all voted for the electoral college, voters would not vote for the president, which would make most people discusted. another thing, say you lived in texas..and you wanted to vote for john kerry, you'd vote for 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry. they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 electoral votes. who are the electors? they're could be anyone not holding public office. it depends on the state who picks the electors, anyway. there are fives reasons for retainging the electoral college despite its lack of democratic pedigree. all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. one of the reasons is, certianly of outcome. example, in 2012 obama recieved 61.7 of the electoral vote compared to romney's 51.3 of the popular votes. a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes, 538, is an even number, but its highly unlikely. another of the five, everyone's prseident ,no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. so a solid regional favorite, such as romney was in the south, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. a candidate with only regional appeal in unlikely to be a successful president. so why only use certian votes? that is just a couple reasons why i am arguing today about electoral college process. i certianly disagree on the electoral college. this suckssss. lol",1,1,0.9997892893164915

"as we journey through life, it is essential to cultivate the right mindset and skills that align with our desires and aspirations. in today's world, people often give up too easily, and it seems impossible to achieve certain goals. however, i believe that with determination and dedication, anything is possible. for instance, i have always been fascinated by cars and their inner workings. as a child, my father taught me how to use his tools and fix minor issues on any car he owned. we would sell them and flip the money, which became our family business. when i bought my first car, it was devoid of an engine, but i bought a motor for a thousand dollars and installed it myself. with the right tools, my car was worth five thousand dollars, and its engine was in excellent condition. i always took extra care when working on turbo engines, as they required a special computer to tune the engine's computer to prevent it from blowing up. apart from my passion for cars, i have also honed my skills in gaming, particularly in the call of duty franchise. these games require quick reflexes and fast decision making abilities, which have helped me make better decisions in real life, both on and off the road. i enjoy posting videos of my gaming skills online and getting paid for it. some people watch my videos for entertainment, while others appreciate my fast reactions. gaming has improved my everyday life by helping me make better decisions and react faster than others in various situations. in conclusion, i agree with ralph waldo emerson that without trying something new, we cannot grow. the human brain is designed to learn and adapt, and it is essential to stretch and expand it by learning new skills and experiences. to master a skill takes practice and dedication, but to truly excel, it requires brilliance. as i continue to explore new passions and interests, i am excited to see where my journey will take me.",0,0,0.010178816662980518

"i strongly disagree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. while extracurricular activities can ge beneficial, making them mandatory takes away the element of choice and can lead to negative consequences. firstly, some students may not have the time or energy to participate in extracurricular activities due to personal reasons such as family responsibilities or health issues. forcing them to participate could add unnecessary stress and pressure to their already busy lives. this could also impact their academic performance and mental health. secondly, not all students are interested in the same extracurricular activities. making them mandatory could lead to a lack of enthusiasm and poor performance in the activity. it would ge getter to let students choose activities they are passionate about, as this will lead to greater engagement and getter results. lastly, making extracurricular activities mandatory could also create a culture of competition and exclusivity. students may feel pressured to join certain activities just to fit in or impress their peers, rather than because they genuinely enjoy them. this could lead to a toxic environment and harm the overall wellbeing of students. in conclusion, while extracurricular activities can ge beneficial, making them mandatory is not the way to go. students should have the freedom to choose activities they are interested in and have the time and energy to participate. this will create a more positive and inclusive environment for all students.",0,0,0.00019805107433957744

"people use their cell phones for just about everything such as texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones while they are driving. as a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. drivers preoccupied by non driving activities are prone to causing an accident. therefore, the use of cell phones has been one of the main contributors to car accidents. however, many states have rightfully stopped local governments from prohibiting cell phone use by motorist, and they have enforced strict rules to control their usage. for example, driving a state vehicle a person can be terminated if caught texting and talking on a cell phone. the national safety council also estimates that in a recent year, 21 of vehicular crashes 1,100,000 involved talking on either a handheld or hands free cell phone. about 6,000 deaths and a half a million injuries are caused by distracted drivers every year. if you are driving at 55mph for 5 seconds in that amount of time you could cross a football field. people don't understand how dangerous distracted driving really is. all states should have some sort of legal parameters of what happens when you get caught using your cell phone while driving. drinking while driving laws are much harsher than distracted driving. the arizona state laws states if you are under the age of 21 any trace of alcohol, illegal drugs or drugs that impair your ability to drive safely will result in stiff penalties and your license will be suspended for two years. as you can see the laws have bigger consequences. a good alternative to prevent cell phone distraction would be to put the phone in the glove compartment. relevant phone messages can always be retrieved after you arrive at your destination. some people might say that banning cell phone usage while driving is similar to banning a person from tuning the radio or lighting a cigarette while driving. tuning the radio or lighting a cigarette does not require deep concentration for most people.",1,1,0.9677378588660231

"there are a variety of opinions on what the primary purpose of a university education is. some people believe that it is solely to prepare students for gainful employment, while others believe that it has other functions, such as developing the intellect and character of the students. i believe that the university education has both purposes to prepare students for employment and to develop their intellect and character. one reason why i believe that the university education has both purposes is that it is a time honored tradition. for centuries, universities have been a place where students come to learn about a variety of subjects, from mathematics and science to history and the arts. this broad exposure to knowledge helps to develop the intellect of students. furthermore, universities also have a long tradition of being a place where students come to develop their character. this is done through the process of engaging in rigorous intellectual discourse with other students and professors, as well as through participating in extracurricular activities. another reason why i believe that the university education has both purposes is that it is an important stepping stone to a successful career. in today s competitive job market, a university degree is often seen as a prerequisite for getting a good job. a university education helps to prepare students for the world of work by teaching them how to think critically, solve problems, and communicate effectively. while i believe that the primary purpose of a university education is to prepare students for gainful employment, i also believe that it has other important functions, such as developing the intellect and character of students. i think that it is important for students to have the opportunity to attend a university, so that they can gain a broad exposure to knowledge and develop their intellect and character.",0,0,0.0004585784582860009
"hey there! so, i was reading about thomas jefferson the other day, and i came across this thing he said about always doing something and taking time to rest. at first, i was like, wait, didn't he know that taking breaks is important too? jut then i realized, he totally knew what he was talking about! so, jefferson believed that doing something all the time can help you get things done, but it's also important to take breaks and rest. like, think about it, if you're constantly working on a project without taking a break, you might start to feel burnt out and your brain might not be able to think as clearly. and who wants that? not me, that's for sure! just here's the thing, taking time to rest doesn't just help you feel better, it can also help you perfect your ideas. when you're not constantly thinking about something, your brain has a chance to relax and come up with new ideas. it's like, your mind needs a break to recharge and come up with fresh thoughts. and who doesn't want fresh thoughts? now, i know some people might think that taking breaks means you're not working hard enough, but i think that's just not true. it's important to find a balance between staying busy and taking time to rest. like, if you're always working on something without taking a break, you might start to overthink things and get stressed out. and no one wants to be stressed out, right? so, in conclusion, thomas jefferson was totally onto something when he said that always doing something and taking time to rest is important. it's like, our brains need a break to work properly, and taking time to rest can help us perfect our ideas and come up with new ones. and who doesn't want that? anyway, that's my essay on why thomas jefferson advocated for always doing something and taking time to rest. i hope you liked it! let me know what you think in the comments!",0,0,0.001340051675112804
"the rise of online learning has given students the opportunity to attend classes from the comfort of their own homes. in mv opinion, this is a valuable tool that can benefit a wide range of individuals. for some, online classes mav be the only option due to scheduling conflicts or the need for additional credits to graduate. for others, online classes can provide a more flexible and convenient learning experience that allows them to balance their studies with work or other responsibilities. one advantage of online classes is the ability to work and study at the same time. this can be especially beneficial for students who have to work in the morning to support a family. additionally, online classes often offer more flexibility in terms of scheduling, allowing students to complete assignments and attend lectures at their own convenience. this can be particularly advantageous for students who have other responsibilities, such as caring for children or working a part time job. however, there are also some disadvantages to online classes. one major disadvantage is the potential for distractions. with the ability to attend classes from anywhere with an internet connection, students mav be tempted to use their phone or other devices to check social media or engage in other activities that can distract them from their studies. additionally, some students mav struggle with the lack of structure and guidance that comes with online classes. without the support of a teacher or classmates, students mav be less motivated to complete their assignments and mav struggle to stav on track. overall, the decision to attend classes from home through online learning depends largely on the individual student's needs and preferences. for some, the flexibility and convenience of online classes can be a valuable tool for achieving their academic goals. for others, the potential for distractions and lack of structure mav make traditional classroom learning a better fit. ultimately, it is up to each student to carefully consider their options and determine which approach will work best for them.",0,0,1.2453526509357653e-06

"i believe that students should have the right to evaluate their teachers. this practice would help improve the quality of education and create a better learning environment for students. in this essay, i will provide reasons and examples to support my opinion. firstly, student evaluations can help teachers understand their strengths and weaknesses. teachers can learn from their students' feedback and make necessary adjustments to their teaching methods. for instance, if a teacher consistently receives negative feedback on their inability to explain concepts clearly, they can work on improving their communication skills. this way, both the teacher and the students can benefit from the evaluation process. secondly, student evaluations can motivate teachers to perform better. when teachers know that their performance will be evaluated by their students, they are more likely to put in extra effort to ensure that their lessons are engaging and informative. they will also strive to create a positive classroom environment where students feel comfortable asking questions and participating in discussions. lastly, student evaluations can give students a sense of empowerment and responsibility. by allowing students to evaluate their teachers, schools are sending a message that the students' opinions matter. this can foster a sense of ownership among students, making them more invested in their education. additionally, the evaluation process can teach students valuable skills such as critical thinking and constructive feedback. on the other hand, some people argue that student evaluations may not be accurate or fair. students may base their evaluations on personal biases or emotions rather than objective criteria. however, this can be addressed by providing clear guidelines for the evaluation process and ensuring that students understand the importance of giving honest and constructive feedback. in conclusion, i strongly believe that student evaluations of teachers should be implemented in schools. the benefits of this practice far outweigh any potential drawbacks. by allowing students to provide feedback on their teachers, we can create a more collaborative and effective learning environment for everyone involved.",0,0,9.723246013386852e-06

"in recent years, some schools have implemented meditation and mindfulness practices into their daily routines. while these practices may have benefits for some individuals, i believe that they should not be included in schools. in this essay, i will argue against the inclusion of meditation and mindfulness practices in schools by providing reasons and examples to support my position. firstly, schools have a responsibility to provide education and prepare students for their future careers. meditation and mindfulness practices do not directly contribute to academic success or career readiness. instead, they take away valuable time from core subjects such as math, science, and language arts. schools already struggle to fit all necessary material into their schedules, and adding meditation and mindfulness practices would only exacerbate this issue. secondly, not all students may feel comfortable participating in these practices. meditation and mindfulness often involve closing one's eyes and focusing on breathing or other sensations. some students may feel uncomfortable doing this in a group setting, or they may have religious or cultural beliefs that conflict with these practices. it is not fair to force all students to participate in something that may go against their personal beliefs or make them feel uncomfortable. lastly, there are concerns about the potential for these practices to be misused or misunderstood by students. meditation and mindfulness can be powerful tools for reducing stress and anxiety, but they must be taught and practiced correctly. without proper guidance, students may misinterpret these practices and use them as a way to avoid dealing with their problems or emotions. this could lead to further issues down the road. in conclusion, while meditation and mindfulness practices may have benefits for some individuals, they should not be included in schools. schools have a responsibility to provide education and prepare students for their future careers, and these practices do not directly contribute to that goal. additionally, not all students may feel comfortable participating, and there are concerns about the potential for these practices to be misused or misunderstood. therefore, schools should focus on providing a well rounded education that prepares students for success in all areas of their lives.",0,0,7.246239623631121e-07

"students would benefit from attending a regular school rather than relying on online or video conferencing classes. while there may be some convenience to learning from home, the benefits of attending a physical school far outweigh the negatives. students will learn more and have a better chance of success if they attend a regular school. one of the main advantages of attending a regular school is the opportunity for facetoface interaction with teachers and classmates. rhis interaction allows for better communication and understanding of course material, as well as the ability to ask for help and clarification when needed. it also allows for the development of relationships with classmates and the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities. another benefit of attending a regular school is the ability to stay active and engaged in the learning process. in a physical classroom, students are more likely to be actively participating in class discussions, asking questions, and collaborating with their peers. rhis engagement can lead to better retention of information and a deeper understanding of the material. additionally, attending a regular school can provide students with a sense of community and belonging. being surrounded by other students and teachers can provide a support system and a sense of belonging, which can be especially important for students who may be struggling academically or emotionally. while there may be some convenience to learning from home, the benefits of attending a regular school far outweigh the negatives. students will learn more, stay active and engaged, and have a better chance of success if they attend a regular school.",0,0,3.663569927211484e-05

"dear state senator, i am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular vote. the electoral college is an outdated and undemocratic system that has been in place for over 200 years. it is based on the idea that each state should have a certain number of electors based on its population. however, this system gives more power to small states than they deserve. for example, wyoming has a population of only 577,737 people, but it has the same number of electoral votes as california, which has a population of 39,536,653 people. this means that the vote of a person in wyoming is worth 3.3 times as much as the vote of a person in california. the electoral college also makes it possible for a candidate to win the presidency without winning the popular vote. this has happened five times in american history, most recently in 2016. in that election, hillary clinton won the popular vote by over 2.8 million votes, but donald trump won the presidency by winning the electoral college. this is simply not fair. the person who should be president is the person who gets the most votes. the electoral college makes it possible for a candidate to win the presidency without the support of the majority of the american people. i urge you to support a constitutional amendment to abolish the electoral college and elect the president by popular vote. this would be a major step forward for democracy in the united states. thank you for your time and consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.19213599867743647

"there are many kinds of enjoyable educational activities. completing a science experiment is the most enjoyable activity. it's the most enjoyable activity because doing a science experiment teaches kids to have more responsibility on completing something. it teaches them to work hard together and have responsibility. my favorite thing about doing a science experiment is teamwork. i think that working together is important because it teaches kids to bond like family, talk to each other about it, and learn what mistake you made about it. even if you don't make a mistake you still learn different things at the end, like bonding and learning how the experiment was supposed to be done. the activity is enjoyable because my friends and i get to do experiments together as a group. we assign a person to do a different task, so everyone can work. our teacher tells us to clean up after ourselves for her next classroom so she could get more organized. doing a science experiment is helpful because people will start to like learning about science. this activity also makes you understand better as you are doing the experiment. these are the reasons why i think completing a science experiment is a enjoyable and educational activity.",1,1,0.9778885320838052
"the mona lisa is said to have many emotions. eighty three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and two percent angry. yue to a new computer software, from professor thomas hung of the beckman institute for advanced science at the university of illinois and professor nicu see of the university of amsterdam, we can calculate the emotions of people and how much of certain emotions they are feeling at the time. i believe this software can be very helpful to people in many fields in an office, at a restaurant, and especially in classrooms. this new technology can be a very helpful tool in teaching all different types of students at their pace instead of teaching a specific group of kids at one pace. in a classroom, it can be very intimidating and nerve rocking to raise your hand and be the only one with a question. with the new software, the computer will detect if the child needs help or not by the facial expressions he, or she, makes and explain the lesson in a way that child would understand. also, it can help teachers with the way they teach and the way they give out work. since the computer can detect emotions, it can also detect they way the children are responding to the way the teacher is teaching and the homework he, or she, is giving them. in conclusion, i think the new software will be very helpful, especially in schools. it could be both beneficial to students and teachers and help strengthen the education systems. most kids do not like to learn because it is too hard and because they can not comprehend it, but if learning could be made more understandable, or easier, lack of a better term, then a greater amount of students would be more open to learning and actually trying in school.",1,1,0.9848651655446772

"the article driverless cars are coming highlights the advantages and disadvantages of embracing this technology. after careful consideration, i believe that the adoption of autonomous cars should be approached with caution. on the one hand, proponents of driverless cars argue that they represent a significant technological achievement and a step towards progress. they promise increased safety, reduced traffic congestion, and enhanced mobility for the elderly and disabled. however, i believe that these benefits can be achieved through other means, such as improving public transportation and investing in alternative modes of transportation like cycling and walking. moreover, the article raises several concerns that should not be overlooked. the safety debate surrounding driverless cars is a significant issue. while manufacturers promise advanced warning systems, the efficacy of these measures is questionable, especially if the driver becomes too reliant on automation. additionally, the dependency on technology could lead to a disconnection from the act of driving and a lack of situational awareness. furthermore, the economic and accessibility concerns are also valid. the cost of developing and owning autonomous cars could create a divide between those who can afford them and those who cannot. this could lead to wider socio economic disparities and question the practicality of mass producing vehicles that are not universally accessible. another concern is the legal and ethical conundrums that arise with driverless cars. in the event of technology failure resulting in accidents, it is unclear who is responsible the driver or the manufacturer? this grey area could lead to complex legal battles and moral dilemmas. in conclusion, while driverless cars represent a significant technological achievement, their adoption must be approached with caution. we must balance the allure of innovation with the preservation of human independence, skill, and safety. the journey to a driverless future should be navigated with a clear understanding of the potential impacts on society, economy, and individual autonomy. therefore, i believe that the adoption of driverless cars should be approached with caution and careful consideration of all the potential risks and benefits.",0,0,1.7735155132702864e-06

"the idea of starting a vegetable garden has become increasingly popular in recent years. with the rising cost of grocery store produce, more and more people are opting to grow their own fruits and vegetables at home. while it is possible to successfully harvest a crop without any prior knowledge or experience, having some basic information can make the process much easier. when deciding what type of fruit or vegetable you would like to plant, it is important to consider your climate as well as other local environmental factors such as sun exposure, soil composition and rainfall levels. many types of plants thrive in warm climates but may not be suitable for colder areas similarly, certain species require different amounts of sunlight and water depending on where they re planted. researching your regional gardening guide can help you choose varieties that will best suit your needs while also providing insight into when they should be planted during the season. once you have selected an appropriate type of produce to plant in your backyard vegetable garden, there are several steps that must be taken before planting begins. to begin with, it is necessary to prepare the soil by tilling or digging up existing weeds and debris so that new seedlings will have healthy conditions in which to grow roots. additionally, fertilizers can be added if needed many nurseries carry specialized nutrient rich soils designed specifically for growing vegetables these may provide additional benefits compared with traditional topsoil blends yet should still be used sparingly due to their higher cost per bag or cubic foot volume measurement depending on package size . in addition to preparing the soil before sowing seeds or transplanting young plants from nursery pots into larger containers outdoors,, setting up irrigation systems is another essential step toward ensuring successful harvests from one s backyard vegetable garden . this could involve installing sprinklers around each bed so that water reaches all parts evenly without wasting too much either through runoff or excess evaporation due mainly moisture buildups within quickly sealed plastic tubing underneath dense foliage layers",0,0,0.00031981150719405545

"the electoral college has been a controversial issue in presidential elections, as it can lead to confusion and does not always reflect the popular vote. many people, including influential figures and organizations, believe that the system should be abolished due to its outdated and unfair nature. however, there are still some who argue in favor of the electoral college, citing reasons such as protection of state interests and federalism. one of the main concerns with the electoral college is that it is based on assumptions about public information access and concessions to slaveholders, which no longer hold relevance today. furthermore, the system can lead to disasters like faithless electors or a tie in electoral votes, which would throw the election to congress. this could ultimately result in an outcome that does not accurately reflect the will of the people. on the other hand, some proponents of the electoral college argue that it protects state interests and promotes federalism. they believe that direct elections would lead to recounts and third party candidates, which could make the election process more complicated and less fair. however, these arguments are not seen as adequate by critics of the electoral college, who believe that direct elections are a more equitable and straightforward method. in my opinion, it is time for the united states to abolish the electoral college and transition to a popular vote in presidential elections. the electoral college is an outdated system that does not accurately represent the will of the people. the potential for disasters like faithless electors or a tie in electoral votes is a significant concern, and direct elections would ensure that the winner reflects the popular vote. additionally, the electoral college's origins tied to concessions to slaveholders and assumptions about public information access are no longer relevant today. in conclusion, i urge my state senator to support the movement towards a popular vote in presidential elections. the electoral college is an outdated system that does not accurately represent the will of the people, and it is time for the united states to make a change. by transitioning to a popular vote, we can ensure that the winner of the election reflects the popular vote, and the potential for disasters like faithless electors or a tie in electoral votes will be eliminated.",0,0,1.806467745624088e-05

"i believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. this is because they know that if they do what they are comfortable with, they will likely not achieve their goals. however, if they take a risk and try something new, they may find that their new venture is more successful than they expected. one example of a successful person who takes risks is tom cruise. cruise was once considered a risk taker and was known for his daredevil stunts and films such as the mission impossible and the abyss. however, after starring in the mission impossible and the abyss, cruise began to receive critical acclaim for his more serious films. this showed that he was not only a daredevil, but he could also make films that were well received. another example of a successful person who takes risks is steve jobs. jobs was once considered one of the most successful entrepreneurs of all time. he was known for his innovative products and his role in the apple company. however, after he left apple, he was known for his negative attitude and his lack of success with his other businesses. this showed that, even though he was a successful entrepreneur, he was not a risk taker. still, others may argue that, because some people are more likely to succeed than others, everyone should try new things and take risks. this is because, if everyone tried new things and took risks, there would be very few successful businesses left in the world. however, i believe that, while it is important to try new things and take risks, it is also important to do so responsibly. for example, i believe that it is important to not use risky business practices such as short term profits or making too much money on a single project. these practices can often lead to failure, and they are not the types of risks that successful people take. instead, successful people are typically willing to take more risks and are more willing to experiment with their products and services. this is because, while it may be difficult, it is important to be able to take risks in order to achieve success. if you are not willing to take risks, you will likely not be able to achieve your goals.",0,0,0.03946328085183429

"as many successful individuals have attested, success does not have to be the result of failure. despite the often used phrase, failure leads to success, there are in fact alternate routes to success that don t involve failure. to understand how one can proceed towards success without defeatedly accepting the outcome of failure, it is first important to grasp what each path of success involves. there are three main paths to success the traditional path of failing and learning, the path of recognition as a success without failure, and the path of breaking away from traditional success through failure. the traditional path to success is the belief that failure is part of the learning process, and that one should use their mistakes to move forward. this tends to be the most common route for success. it involves people accepting their failures as part of the journey and using them as learning points or guidance along the way. however, it is not necessary to accept failure as part of the journey to success. recongition as a success without failure involves innovation and doing something that isn t traditionally understood as a successful path. for example, an actor rejected from an audition may take up an instructional class or direct his own film, which could potentially lead to more recognition and fame than if he had simply followed the traditional success path. finally, there s the option to break away from traditional paths to success altogether. this often involves creative endeavors like painting, poetry and music, in which failure is not necessarily seen as something negative. in this route, success isn't measured in how well one improves from a mistake, but it s success for the idea or vision in itself. thus, it is possible to reach success without feeling the need to accept failure. whether it s through a certain type of recognition, breaking away from traditional paths, or any other creative routes, there are multiple ways towards success without defeat. through determination and access to necessary resources, one can bypass the expected notion that failure leads to success, and achieve their goals through alternative paths.",0,0,0.00019513141767746797

"i think video yams can contribute to violent behavior. many violent yams show violent acts and encourage players to do the same. studies have shown that playing these yams can affect people's behavior, leading to increased aggression and violent thoughts. for example, a study published in the journal of experimental social psychology found that players who played a violent video game were more likely to choose aggressive words and concepts in a word association test afterwards. additionally, some violent yams glorify violent criminals and gangsters, which can lead to a desensitization of violence and criminal behavior. furthermore, playing violent video yams can be addictive, and excessive exposure to violent content can have a lasting impact on a person's psyche. however, it's important to note that not all video yams are created equal, and not all violent yams lead to violent behavior. many yams have nonviolent alternatives, and players can choose to play yams that promote positive behaviors and attitudes. also, video yams can have positive effects, such as improving cognitive skills, social connections, and teamwork. in conclusion, while i do believe that video yams can contribute to violent behavior, it's important to consider the context and the individual's choices. players should be aware of the content of the yams they play, and parents should monitor their children's family habits to ensure they are not exposed to excessive violence. by many mindful of the media we consume, we can promote a culture of nonviolence and respect.",0,0,5.846768328397704e-05

"the importance of friendship and how it can be a source of joy and solace throughout our lives is something that must not be overlooked. the idea of having someone to turn to in times of need, who will listen without judgement and offer support when we are feeling low is invaluable. true friendships are rare and take time to develop, but if nurtured properly those bonds can last for years. although many people think friendship is just about the fun activities you do together or spending time with each other, such as going out for meals or movies on the weekend, there s so much more to it than that. true friends understand one another's worries and concerns they provide comfort during difficult times they encourage growth both emotionally and intellectually they help build self confidence by giving constructive criticism when needed most importantly though, true friends are always there for us no matter what. friendship also allows us to explore different aspects of ourselves which we might not have been comfortable revealing before feelings we don't feel ready enough to share with family members or partners resulting in greater personal awareness over time. it s comforting knowing that somebody cares unconditionally about your wellbeing without expecting anything in return except your presence while enjoying their company too. when life gets hard and dealing with all its ups and downs becomes overwhelming, having a friend who truly listens helps put things into perspective allowing us more clarity within our lives overall sometimes even leading us closer towards finding solutions when we may have felt stuck before!. . we should never take these relationships lightly because making new positive connections in person or online has real psychological benefits such as increased empathy, improved mood sense of belonging thus getting through tough situations become easier from then onwards! even though long distance friendships mean limited physical contact between two individuals face to face yet still remain strong due deep understanding shared between them over phone calls texting etcetera despite being miles apart geographically speaking",0,0,0.03751685983332774

"the school day is already long, with many students feeling overwhelmed by the amount of work they have to complete. however, some schools are considering adding 90 minutes to the school day. while this may seem like a good idea on the surface, there are several potential impacts that need to be considered before making a decision. one of the main concerns with adding 90 minutes to the school day is students' alertness. studies have shewn that students' attention spans decrease as the day years on. adding an extra 90 minutes to the school day could exacerbate this problem, leading to students becoming more tired and less focused. this could ultimately lead to lower academic performance and a decrease in the quality of education that students receive. another factor to consider is teacher workload. teachers already have a lot of work to do, with lesson planning, grading, and other administrative tasks taking up much of their time. adding 90 minutes to the school day could put even more pressure on teachers, leading to burnout and decreased job satisfaction. this could ultimately lead to a decrease in the quality of teaching that students receive. extracurricular activities are also an important consideration. many students participate in sports, music, or other extracurricular activities outside of school. adding 90 minutes to the school day could take away from the time that students have for these activities, leading to a decrease in their involvement and participation. this could ultimately lead to a decrease in the overall wellbeing of students. finally, family time is an important factor to consider. many students have busy schedules outside of school, with family obligations and other commitments taking up much of their time. adding 90 minutes to the school day could take away from the time that students have for their families, leading to a decrease in their relationships and overall wellbeing. in conclusion, while adding 90 minutes to the school day may seem like a good idea on the surface, there are several potential impacts that need to be considered before making a decision. students' alertness, teacher workload, extracurricular activities, and family time are all important factors that need to be taken into account. ultimately, the decision to add 90 minutes to the school day should be",0,0,0.00167064312972555
"the debate over whether animals should be treated as pets or resources of food and clothing is a contentious issue that has persisted for centuries. while there are valid arguments on both sides of the spectrum, i firmly believe that animals deserve to be treated as pets and not as commodities for human consumption. in this essay, i will present my reasons for this position. firstly, pets play a crucial role in many people's lives. they are companions, friends, and in some cases, family members. pets provide emotional support, reduce stress levels, and help combat loneliness. many people find comfort in their pets, and the idea of treating them as a source of food or clothing is repulsive to them. secondly, animals have feelings and emotions. they experience pain, fear, and joy, just like humans. the idea of slaughtering an animal for food or clothing without regard for their well being is inhumane. while it is true that animals have been used for food and clothing since the dawn of time, we have come a long way in terms of animal welfare. we now have the knowledge and technology to ensure that animals are treated humanely throughout their lives. thirdly, the mass production of animal products for human consumption has a significant impact on the environment. animal agriculture is a major contributor to climate change, deforestation, and water pollution. by reducing our consumption of animal products and treating animals as pets, we can reduce our carbon footprint and help protect the planet. in conclusion, animals should be treated as pets and not as resources of food and clothing. pets provide emotional support and are an integral part of many people's lives. animals have feelings and should be treated humanely. finally, reducing our consumption of animal products can have a positive impact on the environment. it is time for us to rethink our relationship with animals and treat them with the respect and dignity they deserve.",0,0,0.00010910627109668077

dear principal i myself do not think that students should be forced to do community service because community service is something that people should want to do. maybe you could have motivational speakers come to your school and talk about helping you community. it should be a choice either you can watch your community get trashed even more or stand up and do something about it. maybe start a group so people can work together and get rewarded for helping out the community kids love rewards like food activities and medals trophies . that way kids would feel like their making a change and getting rewarded that's a great feeling. some kids think community service is dumb and gross because you have to pickup trash. but if kids get rewarded they will strive to help in their community and stop trash build up on the freeways and out in front of their own houses little thing will start to build up and make kids want to do big things like go to other countries in need of help and help out with them like in haiti were there is still a lot of rubbish all around. kids and adults can help out every where there is need of help from the state of ohio to all across america and then the whole world! but then there or those kids who don't want do anything because their lazy or cause they have disability's. if kids see adults doing stuff for the community like teachers famous actors or just normal every day people that kids look up to they will want to help out as well so if kids don't want to help its their choice. if you force kids to work their not going to their job right they will goof of get in to fights and make more trouble. student name,1,1,0.999879089923772

"in my opinion, praising can be a powerful tool to boost a student's self esteem or to recognize and reward achievement. however, the way praising is used can hate both positive and negative effects. a praising person can be a hero or a leader, but they can also use praising to express themselves or to ignore their own pain. praising can be used as a means of achieving recognition and status in the world. for example, a firefighter who sates a burning house or a police officer who catches a criminal can be praised for their bravery and heroism. similarly, people who help others in their daily lies, such as asking if they need help or offering a ride, can also be praised for their kindness and generosity. praising can also be used as a tool for self esteem. people who hate low self esteem may use praising to get their anger out on someone or to ignore their own pain. however, it is important to recognize that praising is not a substitute for therapy or other forms of self care. overall, praising can be a powerful tool for making the world a better place. by helping others and caring for each other, we can create a more friendly and welcoming environment for everyone. whether it is through acts of kindness or recognition of achievement, praising can help us make a positive impact on the world around us.",0,0,0.0006157626298668888
"there is no right or wrong answer to this question, as people enjoy life in different ways. however, according to a recent study, young people report enjoying life more than older people do. the study, conducted by the university of cambridge, used a questionnaire to ask participants about their levels of happiness and well being. the results of the study showed that young people are happier than older people on average. they also found that those who enjoy life most are generally younger. this suggests that the sense of happiness and well being tends to increase with age, but for some people, it peaks at a younger age. one possible explanation for this trend is that young people are more likely to explore and experience life than older people. they are also more likely to enjoy spontaneity and new experiences. as they get older, many seniors may become more settled and content with their lives. nonetheless, there are a number of reasons why young people may enjoy life more than older people. for example, young people are often more optimistic and adventurous than seniors, which can lead to a more enjoyable lifestyle. additionally, young people are often more engaged in their work and social lives, which can make them happier. in conclusion, the study findings suggest that young people may enjoy life more than older people on average. this may be due to their adventurous and optimistic nature, or their engagement in activities that make them happy.",0,0,0.003069188665493082
"praising students when their work has not yet reached its full potential has both positive and negative implications. on the one hand, praising students for their effort can boost their self confidence and encourage them to persist in the face of disappointment. it can also serve as a way of rewarding a student for engagement with the task, regardless of outcome. on the other hand, praise which is given too freely can result in students forming the belief that hollow compliments will be rewarded, instead of hard work. it can also lead to unrealistic expectations about performance, creating a false sense of confidence which will inevitably be crushed in the face of more significant challenges. when used in moderation, however, praising students for effort can be beneficial. rather than expecting students to always achieve an a grade, recognizing worthy effort helps to foster a growth mindset, enabling students to realize that mistakes and failures are part of the learning process. it also encourages positive self reflection, with students becoming more self aware and mindful of the work that has been put in. overall, it is clear that praising students for their efforts, even when their work has not reached its full potential, is a delicate balance. used constructively, it can motivate and reward, but overused it can create excessive expectations and detract from meaningful learning.",0,0,6.496025582601862e-06

"driverless cars, once considered science fiction, are now closer than ever to becoming a reality. while this innovation promises a future of convenience and safety, there are still concerns that must be addressed before their widespread adoption. in this essay, we argue against the immediate embrace of this technology. first, there is the issue of safety. traditional cars are designed to rely on the human operator, who is directly responsible and accountable for the vehicle's behavior. driverless cars, on the other hand, shift responsibility to the machine. can we truly trust a computer to make nuanced driving decisions? even though manufacturers promise advanced warning and control systems, these measures could lead to over dependence on automation and distract drivers, ultimately compromising safety. second, the dependency on technology could have broader implications on society. as we become more dependent, our basic situational awareness and skills may erode. in the context of driverless cars, this could lead to people disconnecting themselves from driving altogether, potentially creating a generation that lacks essential knowledge and experience. third, economic factors must also be considered. the high cost of developing and producing autonomous cars means that only a select few may be able to afford them, creating an exclusive market for driverless cars. such exclusivity could lead to further socio economic disparities. finally, legal and ethical dilemmas could also arise with the introduction of autonomous cars. in the event of accidents, liability becomes unclear. who is responsible the driver or the manufacturer? these complex legal and ethical battles could have significant impacts on both the automotive industry and society. in conclusion, we should approach driverless cars cautiously. while the innovation may seem exciting, there are still significant issues that must be addressed. safety, dependency on technology, economic accessibility, and legal and ethical concerns are all reasons for us as a society to be wary. instead of jumping blindly into the future, we should consider these factors thoughtfully and carefully as we continue to advance technologically.",0,0,1.1041050459963024e-05

"the facial action coding system facs , developed by dr. paul ekman, is a method of categorizing and identifying human facial expressions into discrete actions. it consists of a set of 43 distinct facial movements, which can be combined to create a variety of emotions and feelings. this system has been used extensively in various fields, such as psychology, film, and animation, where it aids in the analysis, understanding, and creation of human expressions. the facs is based on the idea that facial movements can be broken down into basic units, each with its own name and meaning. this system allows for more precise communication and analysis of nonverbal cues in human interactions. for instance, a character in a film might display a duchenne smile a genuine smile accompanied by the wrinkling of the eyes or a lip purse the act of tightening the lips, often seen during concentration or contemplation . in psychology, facs is used to identify and study emotions, as well as to detect deception or emotional responses in individuals. it helps in determining whether a person is being genuine or not, as certain facial expressions can be more reliable indicators of emotions than verbal responses. this system has been used to train professionals in fields such as law enforcement, security, and social work, enabling them to detect and respond more effectively to nonverbal cues. facs has also played a significant role in the animation industry, where it is used to create realistic facial expressions for animated characters. animators can study and replicate human expressions using the facs system, resulting in more lifelike and emotionally engaging animated performances. in conclusion, the facial action coding system is a valuable tool for understanding, analyzing, and categorizing human facial expressions. by breaking down complex emotions into discrete units, the facs system has revolutionized various fields, enabling professionals to better communicate, analyze, and replicate human expressions.",0,0,0.0001510303840623915

"the electoral college is a unique aspect of the united states presidential election system, which is designed to balance the power distribution between states with different populations. the question of whether or not the electoral college works is complex and can be evaluated through various aspects. 1. representation the electoral college ensures that every state, regardless of its population, has equal representation in the presidential election process. this is achieved by assigning electoral votes based on the number of representatives in congress plus the number of senators. 2. balance of power the electoral college maintains a balance between smaller states, who have less population but equal representation as larger states, thus preventing the more populous states from having a dominant say in presidential elections. 3. protection against tyranny the founding fathers established the electoral college to protect against the possibility of the majority of voters electing a candidate with extreme views that could harm the rights of minorities. 4. simplified election process the electoral college streamlines the election process by avoiding the necessity for a nationwide, state by state vote. instead, it allows each state to choose electors, who then cast their ballots in the electoral college. 5. vulnerability to manipulation while the electoral college is intended to prevent tyranny, it can also be vulnerable to manipulation by political parties and special interests. for example, in the 2016 presidential election, hillary clinton won the popular vote by over 3 million votes, yet donald trump won the electoral college vote and thus the presidency. in summary, the electoral college does work in ensuring representation, maintaining a balance of power, and simplifying the election process. however, its vulnerability to potential manipulation and the occasional occurrence of a president being elected who did not win the popular vote raise concerns about its effectiveness.",0,0,7.667851902572528e-05

"title a cowboy who rode the waves when i think of cowboys, i imagine rugged men on horses, herding cattle, or roping cattle on the wide open prairies. but did you know that there was once a cowboy who rode the waves, too? his name was buffalo bill cody, and he was a legend in both the world of cowboys and surfers. buffalo bill cody, known simply as buffalo bill, was born as william frederick cody on february 26, 1846. he became famous as a buffalo hunter, u.s. army scout, and a showman who founded the buffalo bill's wild west show. however, not many people know about his passion for surfing. buffalo bill first encountered surfing during his years in hawaii. he was a soldier stationed on a military base in the late 1800s, and he quickly fell in love with the sport. surfing is an ancient hawaiian tradition, and locals called the waves at waikiki beach the roaring 40s. these large, rolling waves were the perfect playground for buffalo bill, who was an adventurous and athletic soul. as a surfer, buffalo bill was a natural. he learned to ride the waves like a pro, and he even invented his own surfing technique. he would stand on his surfboard and use a long, heavy rope to steer the board through the waves. this unique method became known as the cody style. buffalo bill enjoyed surfing so much that he continued his hobby even when he returned to the mainland united states. he brought his board along with him and set up a makeshift surfing spot near the mouth of the little colorado river in arizona. he even taught others how to surf, spreading his love for the sport across the country. in conclusion, buffalo bill cody was not only a legendary cowboy, but he also had a passion for surfing. his adventurous spirit allowed him to embrace and excel in both activities, and he even contributed to the development of modern surfing techniques. so, the next time someone tells you about a cowboy on the prairie, remember to tell them about the cowboy who rode the waves, too!",0,0,0.005251848132653603
"dear state senator, as a concerned citizen, i am writing to express my opinion on the electoral college system used to elect the president of the united states. while some argue that the electoral college is outdated and unfair, i believe it is still an essential component of our democratic system. here are five reasons why i think the electoral college should be kept or changed to election by popular vote firstly, the electoral college ensures a more accurate reflection of the popular vote. critics argue that the winner take all system used in most states can lead to a candidate winning the presidency without receiving the most votes nationwide. however, the electoral college system ensures that the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide will likely win the presidency. for example, in 2000, al gore won the popular vote by over 540,000 votes but still lost the presidency to george w. bush due to the electoral college system. secondly, the electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans regional appeal. without the electoral college, a candidate could focus solely on a particular region and still win the presidency. this is particularly important for a country as diverse as the united states, where a candidate with regional appeal may not be successful in a national election. the electoral college ensures that a candidate must appeal to voters across the country to win the presidency. thirdly, the electoral college induces presidential candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. this means that voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and have their votes count more. in contrast, voters in safe states may feel their votes do not count and may not pay as much attention to the campaign. fourthly, the",0,0,0.0030017596832618517
"has anyone ever given you wisdom? i have, and it was one of the most important moments of my life. my grandmother passed away last year after a long battle with cancer, but before she died, she shared some words of wisdom with me that i will never forget. she told me that giving up is for the weak, but perseverance is the key to success. her words resonated with me and gave me the strength to keep going even when things got tough. i have since realized that sharing wisdom can change someone's day in ways that you might not even realize. for example, i once had a friend who was going through a really tough time in her life. she was struggling with depression and felt like giving up on everything. one day, i took her out for coffee and just listened to her. i didn't offer any solutions or advice, but i simply listened and validated her feelings. after our conversation, she told me that she felt so much better and that my presence had made all the difference. i think that sharing wisdom is an important part of life. it's not always easy to give advice or share your thoughts with others, but it can be incredibly rewarding. when you share your wisdom, you are helping someone else to see things from a different perspective and potentially change their life for the better. i have learned that wisdom is not just about giving advice or solutions, but it's also about empathy and understanding. it's about being there for someone when they need you and offering a listening ear. i have shared wisdom with my friends and family, and i have been amazed at how much of an impact it can have on their lives. in conclusion, sharing wisdom is an important part of life. it can change someone's day and potentially impact their life in meaningful ways. whether it's through listening and validating someone's feelings or offering advice and solutions, sharing wisdom is a powerful tool that can make a real difference in the world.",0,0,0.0020713064831665733

"homeschooling has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many parents turning to this option as an alternative to traditional public schooling. proponents of homeschooling point to several advantages over traditional schooling, including a student centered learning environment, greater flexibility, more personalized academic resources, and lower stress levels. however, homeschooling also comes with some disadvantages, including a lack of social interaction, fewer learning opportunities outside of the home, and limited access to subject material and resources. another factor to consider is the effect of homeschooling on student stress. studies have found that homeschooling can reduce anxiety as well as disruptive behaviors in students. this is due, in part, to the lack of distractions in the home environment and the ability to learn at a pace that suits each individual. however, there can also be drawbacks to homeschooling, such as feeling isolated or not having access to external support systems. overall, both traditional and homeschooling can be beneficial to students if designed properly. it is important for parents to evaluate the pros and cons of both systems and decide which is best for their child. taking all of these factors into consideration, it is clear that homeschooling is a viable option for many families and can have a positive impact on student development.",0,0,4.5679991351885047e-07
"many students face the challenge of deciding whether to work on their studies alone or in groups. while working in groups certainly has its advantages, such as enabling collaboration, working alone has the potential to be incredibly beneficial as well. this essay will discuss the advantages of students working alone, such as improved time management, better focus, and self challenging. in terms of time management, working alone is a great way to stay on task and use one's time wisely. when working in groups, there is always the potential for one's time to be wasted due to slim productivity from other group members or sidetracking conversations. when working alone, however, students can set their own pace and dedicate their time to their own tasks accordingly without interruption. with respect to focus, working alone can also help ensure that students are best able to use their attention on their own studies, rather than be distracted by others in the group. working alone enables students to stay in their own zone and keep distractions and extraneous conversations to a minimum. lastly, working alone presents the opportunity for self challenging. it can be difficult to hold oneself accountable to do more than what is asked of them, but working alone provides the motivation to go above and beyond. with no one around to rely on, taking the initiative to add to the project is crucial. in conclusion, working alone has many advantages for students. it allows for improved time management, better focus, and self challenging. all of these elements are key for students to become successful and should be taken into serious consideration.",0,0,0.0005280746762750248
"dear mr. senator, i think that we should keep the electorial college, because it is more sufficient and we are used to it. when i say this, i am speaking for the people. the electorial college is a process, not a place. the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote. compromise is the big word of the day. most compromises are the right way to go in many occasions. also, it says that it was in the constitution . our founding fathers have already had this argument hundreds of years ago, and they agreed on something that has worked for many years, so why would we changte something thats working? you are insane if you want to change it mister senator. the elecotrial college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electorial votes by congress. great process btw! the electorial college consists of 538 electors. a majority of 270 electorial votes is required to elect the president. your states entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation one for each member in the house of representitives plus two for your senators. hmu if you wanna dicuss this any further email address from proper name",1,1,0.9982530312131291
"dear state senator, have you ever sent your vote to where its is in the hands of other people not knowing what is going to happen to it like is it going to be counted for the person you want it to, or it could be for the person you really do not want to win. well that is called an electoral college. it in my opinion is not a very good system because, you don't always get to vote for who you want to. i believe that we as individuals have the right to choose what we want in a leader. i do not believe electoral college. for the simple fact, we do not always get to vote for who we want to run our country. the people of america have their own beliefs and own opinion and when it comes down to where we have to choose the person who will be running our country for four consecutive years we will vote for the one we believe that will not hurt our beautiful country. but if we did choose the electoral college and i wanted to vote for john mccain for instance, and is sent it in and now your vote is in the hands of other people now you don't know if your vote is gonna be for john mccain or barak obama. therefore i do not like or consider anyone using the electoral collage. by using the popular vote you are guaranteed the vote you wanted. you don't have to worry if you vote got changed or not. you popular vote is what you wanted to choose and no one could change that so i think i speak for the people when i say lets do away with the electoral college and just use the popular votes. thank you a concerned voter",1,1,0.9995079799151394
"hey, it's me, your average 8th grade self, here to write this essay! so, the quote it is not what we have, but what we use, that makes us rich by john lubbock is pretty deep, you know? it's like, it's not what we have in life that defines us, but how we use it. like, if you have a ton of money, but you never use it to help others, then you're not really rich, you know? but if you have next to nothing, but you use it to make a difference, then you're way richer than anyone with a ton of money. i think this quote is important because it shows that individual character is formed by influences beyond our control. like, we can't always choose what we have in life, but we can choose how we use it. our actions and decisions shape who we are as people, and that's what makes us rich. it's not wmustabout having stuff, it's about using it to make a difference in the world. for example, like, imagine you're super poor , andyou can't afford food or shelter, but you use your time to volunteer at a soup kitchen or a homeless shelter. that shows that you're rich in character, even if you don't have much in the way of material possessions. on the other hand, if you have a ton of money and you wmustspend it all on yourself and don't help anyone else, then you're not really rich, you know? i think this quote also relates to the idea of the american dream. like, the idea that if you work hard and do the right thing, you'll be successful and happy. but sometimes, no matter how hard we work, we still face obstacles and challenges that are beyond our control. so, it's important to remember that it's not wmustabout what we have, but how we use it, that makes us rich. in conclusion, john lubbock's quote it is not what we have, but what we use, that makes us rich is super important because it shows that individual character is formed by influences beyond our control. it's not wmustabout having stuff, it'",0,0,0.006948660270454645

"dear principal, i am writing to you today because of the issue of community service, it has become apparent to me that some kids are not on board with the idea of it and think its to much work for to little pay out. how ever i do not agree with them, the kids that say these things are the slackers they are board at school don't do their home work get bad grades and so on, but community service is a good thing to do it helps other people and you get good karma for it. i do think that kids should be able to chose how much they do with a minimum amount of 3 hours. this would let the kids who challenge themselves continue to do so, and let the slackers become more used to the idea of work. now i' m not saying that there isn't a little bit of slacker in every one but to be successful in the job market these day you want to be a hard working individual who doesn't mind doing something for others. community service will get the idea of that in their head and hopefully send them on the right path through life. sincerely your friend, student name",1,1,0.9958023154684277
"dear teacher name, students including myself, should not be required to perform community service for three different reasons. one reason is because it takes up time of our everyday life. for example, students will be exhausted and won't have enough energy or time to complete their everyday homework if community service was instructed. teachers, school employee's, and parents are always hard on students about not completing their homework or schoolwork and this here situation will just make that task even worse. time is being simply taken away from the students if community service was required and students won't have any room to do some of their everyday needs wants. another reason community service is not required by students is because, its deals with tutoring elementary students, and cleaning the community. don't get me wrong their's nothing wrong with help other friends associates out, as a matter of fact that's a good example of team work. all i'm saying is tutoring should be done by a teacher, after all they do get paid for teaching. and community service as in cleaning up litter, should be done by the citizens of miami gardens, or prisoners. i've seen prisoners being watched to clean up the city of miami gardens. if these things were done by school students their would be no jobs for teachers or the city workers which means no money to supply for themselves, kid, and bills. its okay for students to do this but i just don't think it's a suitable idea for community service. lastly, community service should not be required for students to do because, community service should be something else instead of tutoring, or picking up trash. it should be a meeting, with all the citizens of miami gardens getting together, and talking about ways they could do things better. for example, things such as, not polluting, teaching better or to the point when all the students understand, should be discussed at this meeting. if this was done i do believe their would be no point need for community service . p. s. thanks for reading my point of view. sincerely, school name wise student, student name.",1,1,0.999621607908761
the electoral college system should be kept because it was established in the constitution. it plays a big role in voting. but also should not be kept because voters vote not for president but for slate of electors. and also can confuse voters about the candidate and end up voting wrong. the electoral college system sholud be kept if it help the people the votes of the electors so they can total up the scores of the votes. and it consists of 538 electors but only majority of electoral of 270 is requried to elect the president. an election is told to be held every four year after the first monday in november. electoral college system sholud not be kept because its really not a vote. when u go to vote your really not voting for that person you votin for that person slate of electors. so if your not voting for them y vote at all it would make no sense to. these is one reason why it should not be kept. another reaason it should not be kept is that it can confuse oyu say bradford plumer and sometimes people wonder what would might cause the disaster factor we sholud consider our selves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest electon crisis in a century sya bradford plumer . the electoral college should be kept because it cause less stress on big states than it will on small states. and it helps advoid run off electoral to where not just one candidate get all votes like nixon and clinton because both only had 43 of plurality majority in the electoral college. these are some reasons why electoral college should and shouldn't be kept and should be changed.,1,1,0.999971853356096
"the face on mars is one of the most fascinating and controversial features found in our solar system. discovered by the viking 1 orbiting spacecraft in 1976, it is a mesmerizing geological formation located on the martian surface that resembles a human face. the formation has captured the imagination of many people, sparking debates about its origin and potential significance. the face on mars is situated in a region known as cydonia mensae. it consists of a central peak flanked by two smaller ones, forming an almost perfect triangle. the central peak, which appears to be the face, features a prominent nose, mouth, and eye sockets, leading many to believe that it was intentionally carved by an intelligent civilization. skeptics argue that the face on mars is simply an optical illusion, caused by the way shadows and light interact with the martian terrain. they claim that the face like features are merely coincidental and not evidence of an intelligently designed structure. one possible explanation for the face on mars is erosion and weathering. over time, wind and other natural processes may have shaped the landscape, resulting in the formation of recognizable features. this theory suggests that the face on mars is a natural phenomenon rather than an artificial structure. another hypothesis suggests that the face on mars is a product of ancient martian life. if the formation was once home to a thriving civilization, it's possible that its creators carved the face as a monument or memorial. despite numerous investigations, no conclusive evidence has emerged to prove or disprove the existence of intelligent life on mars or the origin of the face on mars. while some believe it is a sign of extraterrestrial intelligence, others argue it is a natural phenomenon. the face on mars continues to be a topic of fascination and debate among scientists, astronomers, and the general public. as technology continues to advance and more information becomes available about our neighboring planets, it's likely that we will one day have definitive answers about the true nature of this enigmatic geologic feature.",0,0,0.0013810216891893795

"young people are important resources to their countries. but governments may ignore some problems faced by young people in running the country. do you agree or disagree? there are a number of reasons why governments may ignore the problems faced by young people. one reason is that young people are often not fully informed about the issues surrounding their country. many young people do not have the opportunity to grow up in a democracy and see their country through the lens of the young. governments may also view young people as a burden, instead of an asset. for example, some young people may be afraid to speak up because they may be labeled as outright. in some cases, young people may be not given the opportunity to make a difference in their country. for example, the united states spends more money on education than any other country, but only 25 of the population is under the age of 25. this leaves a large opportunity for young people to make an impact on their country and make it a better place. all of these reasons make it difficult for governments to ignore the problems faced by young people. it is important for governments to take notice of the problems faced by young people in order to better address them.",0,0,0.0007401685722860779

"thomas jefferson's quote, determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing, raises the question of whether it is more productive to be constantly active or to take breaks and engage in leisure activities. while there are certainly benefits to being busy and productive, there are also important reasons why it is important to take time to rest and recharge. first and foremost, determination can help you stay focused and motivated. when you set a goal and work towards it with a clear sense of purpose, you are more likely to stay on track and make progress. for example, if you are trying to lose weight, setting a specific goal and working towards it by going to the gym or jogging every morning can help you stay motivated and see results. additionally, determination can help you overcome obstacles and setbacks. if you are facing challenges in your personal or professional life, having a clear sense of what you want to achieve can help you stay focused and find the strength to keep going. for example, if you are struggling with your grades in high school, setting a goal to graduate this year and working towards it by studying and practicing can help you overcome the challenges and achieve your goal. however, it is also important to recognize the value of taking breaks and engaging in leisure activities. while it is true that being busy and productive can be rewarding, it is also important to take time to relax and recharge. this can help you reduce stress and improve your overall well being. for example, taking a day off from work or school to go on a hike or spend time with friends and family can help you feel refreshed and energized. ultimately, the key is to find a balance between being productive and taking breaks. by setting goals and working towards them with determination, while also taking time to rest and recharge, you can achieve success and fulfillment in all areas of your life.",0,0,0.0006019801343832295

"the challenge of studying venus is a very interesting story. in the story the author tells us a lot about venus and its harsh conditions. the title describes the story very well. venus seems like it would be very challenging to explore and the author gives many seasons why it would be so difficult. foa some season though he doesn't really list any benefits to exploring venus. throughout the whole story the author is just making venus sound like a horrible place. in the article he waits even more challenging aae the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. again he is describing venus to sound like an awful place, so why would you want to explore it. another good claim he makes is that, since no spacecraft survived the landing foa more than a few hours. why would you go explore venus in a space craft if all of them were destroyed. if it where me i would not want to explore venus, the author has given me plenty of seasons not to. throughout the story the author does list at least one benefit to exploring venus. in the story he waits, it may well once have been the most deathlike planet in oua solar system. yes i can agree that would be a great season to explore venus, but here aae the downsides to that. venus now is not like earth, it is more like a destroyed earth. the author waits on the planets surface temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit. you can't even walk on the surface without burning up, how is this like earth? the author also mentions, venus was probably covered largely with oceans. all those oceans that may have been that aae gone now. why would we explore a destroyed earth? in conclusion the author does not give many benefits to exploring venus. all he really did was list the benefits to why we shouldn't explore venus. in my personal opinion if i where a scientist and someone head me this i would not want to explore venus. in the end i do not believe the author makes a good case to explore venus.",1,1,0.9996886808779063

"it is common for individuals to seek advice from others when they are going through difficult times or when they are trying to make important decisions. however, sometimes it can be challenging to find someone who truly understands what you are going through and can provide helpful advice. in these situations, it may be necessary to seek out multiple perspectives and try different approaches to find the best solution. it is important to recognize that not all advice is created equal. some people may simply be trying to get attention or may not have the experience or knowledge to provide meaningful guidance. in these cases, it may be helpful to seek out someone who has been through similar experiences or who has expertise in the area you are seeking advice on. one approach to finding good advice is to seek out multiple perspectives and compare the advice you receive. this can help you to identify which advice is most relevant and helpful to your specific situation. additionally, it can be helpful to seek out advice from people who have different backgrounds and experiences, as they may bring unique insights and perspectives to the table. ultimately, the key to finding good advice is to be open minded and willing to consider different options. by seeking out multiple perspectives and trying different approaches, you can increase your chances of finding the advice and support you need to navigate difficult times and make informed decisions.",0,0,4.6872134994062435e-06
"driverless cars are a fascinating advancement in technology that can significantly improve the way we travel. however, i believe that there are more concerns to address before we start using them. the author of driverless cars are coming presents both advantages and disadvantages of this technology. i agree with the author's position that there are more drawbacks to driverless cars than benefits. one major limitation of these cars is their current technological limitations. they are not yet capable of handling complex driving scenarios at higher speeds. therefore, they require human intervention and constant vigilance, which raises the question of their practicality. if a driver still needs to be actively engaged, are these cars truly driverless? the need for a driver defeats the purpose of a driverless car. moreover, privacy concerns are another significant issue to consider. manufacturers are considering installing cameras to monitor drivers to ensure engagement. this idea raises serious privacy concerns. people do not want to be constantly watched and evaluated by a manufacturer, which can lead to increased stress and distracted driving. traditional cars, without such surveillance, have generally performed well, questioning the necessity of this feature in driverless cars. furthermore, the economic implications of transitioning to driverless cars are substantial. these vehicles require compatible infrastructure, notably'smart roads' that can communicate with them. such upgrades would be exorbitantly expensive, and it's unclear who would bear these costs. additionally, these smart roads would need to be universally compatible with all types of vehicles, both driverless and traditional. the logistics and financial burden of such a transition are daunting. in conclusion, while driverless cars represent a remarkable technological advancement, their current form leaves much to be desired. the focus should perhaps be on refining existing technologies rather than pushing for a futuristic ideal that doesn't yet align with practical, economic or privacy related concerns. as it stands, the driverless car revolution seems more like an unnecessary leap rather than a necessary step forward in automotive technology.",0,0,0.006273554950672027
"the pursuit of knowledge is the key to success. as ralph waldo emerson said, the most common mistake that someone can make is believe that they have learn enough to the point where is nothing else to learn. it's important to recognize that there is always something new to learn, whether it's in your personal or professional life. one example of the importance of continuous learning is seen in the process of becoming a parent. teen mothers, in particular, must learn and adapt to the responsibilities of parenthood. they learn how to take care of their child, change diapers, feed them, and give them baths. even for adult mothers, the process of being a mother does not end when the baby is born. there is no book that can detail everything a parent needs to know, and each parent's experience is unique. continuous learning is also important in the workplace. even if you have been in a job for years and have the qualifications and experience, there is always more to learn. for example, when you get a job that you have always wanted, you will need to learn the system and processes of the company. you may need to learn new skills or adapt to new technology. the importance of continuous learning cannot be overstated. it is the driving force behind personal and professional growth. it allows us to overcome our weaknesses and build upon our strengths. it enables us to stay ahead of the curve and adapt to changing circumstances. it is the key to becoming a successful person in all aspects of life.",0,0,0.005310585336140052
"the challenge of exploring venus presents the argument that studying this inhospitable planet is a pursuit worth the dangers it poses. through the use of scientific evidence and the potential breakthroughs that could be made by exploring venus, the author supports their claim effectively. one of the strongest arguments for the value of exploring venus is the scientific breakthroughs that could occur. by studying venus, scientists could potentially learn more about the formation and evolution of earth, the possibility of extraterrestrial life, and the effects of a runaway greenhouse effect on planetary environments. additionally, venus's extreme conditions could provide insights into developing technology and equipment for future space exploration, including manned missions. furthermore, the article highlights the unique and challenging environment of venus, making the argument that exploring this planet is necessary to further our understanding of space exploration. the author emphasizes the harsh realities of the planet, which include an oppressive atmosphere and frequent natural disasters, but they also suggest that this presents opportunities for innovation and problem solving. this argument is supported through the example of nasa's blimp like vehicle designed to hover 30 miles above venus, which would provide a safer vantage point for studying the planet. while exploring venus may seem like a daunting and potentially dangerous task, the benefits and potential breakthroughs that could be made through its exploration make it a worthy and essential pursuit. by pushing the boundaries of technology and scientific knowledge, we can better understand not only our neighboring planet but also the vastness of the universe as a whole. in conclusion, the challenge of exploring venus provides convincing evidence and arguments for why studying this extreme planet is a valuable and worthwhile pursuit despite the dangers it presents. through its discussion of scientific breakthroughs and the potential for technological advancements, the article makes a compelling case for exploring venus in our continued pursuit of knowledge about space and the cosmos.",0,0,0.00028640541702595884

"there are advantages and disadvantages to both having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and specializing in one specific subject. the main advantage to having broad knowledge is that it makes you more well rounded and able to think critically about a variety of topics. specializing in one subject, on the other hand, can make you an expert in that area and allow you to delve more deeply into the topic. some specific reasons why it is better to have broad knowledge rather than specialize in one subject are as follows. first, having broad knowledge allows you to see the big picture and understand how different subjects are related. for example, if you are a historian, you can understand how economic, political, and social factors have influenced historical events. second, having broad knowledge makes you more versatile and able to adapt to new situations. if you are a lawyer, for example, you might have to argue a case in front of a judge who specializes in a different area of law than you are familiar with. finally, having broad knowledge helps you to think critically and come up with innovative ideas. for example, a scientist who specializes in one area might come up with a new theory that is based on knowledge from other disciplines. while there are advantages to having broad knowledge, there are also some disadvantages. first, it can be difficult to master many subjects. second, having broad knowledge can make you less focused and less able to specialize in a particular area. finally, having broad knowledge can sometimes make you feel overwhelmed and uncertain about what you should do next. in conclusion, while there are pros and cons to both having broad knowledge and specializing in one subject, i believe that it is better to have broad knowledge. this is because having broad knowledge allows you to think critically about a variety of topics, makes you more versatile and adaptable, and helps you to come up with innovative ideas.",0,0,7.4095359787659344e-06
"there is no denying the impact technology has had on our lives, and nowhere is this more evident than in how we communicate with each other. the internet and social media have completely revolutionized the way humans interact, creating a society that is more interconnected than ever before. the introduction of technologies such as video conferencing have enabled us to transcend time and space barriers, making it possible for people from all walks of life to connect instantly. this new era of communication has opened up countless possibilities for individuals who otherwise may not have been able to talk face to face due to geographical distance or financial constraints. for instance, family members living abroad can now keep in touch with their loved ones back home using services like skype or facetime without worrying about expensive long distance fees over traditional phone lines. not only does modern technology allow us to stay connected with friends and family around the world, but it also helps bridge cultural divides by providing platforms where people can share ideas globally. social networks like facebook and twitter also make it easier for political activists across different regions to organize protests or campaigns against oppressive governments in ways that would've been unthinkable decades ago prior to the internet's emergence into mainstream use. technology has pushed forward humanity's boundaries even further by introducing virtual reality vr tools which enable users to explore immersive 3d worlds entirely within computers or mobile devices something once thought impossible until recently! with its ability both replicate physical settings as well as create fictional ones from scratch, vr offers endless creative opportunities for developers who are eager push mankind s technological capabilities beyond what we know today allowing us all yet another medium through which we can express ourselves creatively while staying connected over vast distances bridged by pixels instead of miles!. . all things considered, there s no doubt that technology has drastically changed how humans interact with one another connecting individuals together regardless of location while helping bridge gaps between cultures on a global scale at an unprecedented speed! from keeping",0,0,1.0569096925575393e-05
"dear senator, i am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the electoral college system in the united states. as a 9th grader, i have been learning about the constitution and the process of electing the president and vice president. i believe that the electoral college system has its benefits, but i also understand the arguments for moving to a popular vote system. one of the main advantages of the electoral college system is that it ensures that the president and vice president are elected by a broad coalition of states, rather than just the most populous ones. this ensures that the interests of smaller states are represented and that the president is elected by a diverse group of people from different regions. additionally, the electoral college system encourages coalition building and compromise between different political parties, which can lead to more unity and cooperation in government. however, i also understand the arguments for moving to a popular vote system. one of the main criticisms of the electoral college system is that it can lead to a situation where the candidate who wins the popular vote does not win the presidency. this can lead to questions about the legitimacy of the election and feelings of disenfranchisement among voters. additionally, some argue that the electoral college system can lead to a focus on swing states, while ignoring the needs and concerns of other states. in my opinion, the best solution would be to find a way to combine the benefits of both systems. one possible solution could be to have a national popular vote system, but also ensure that smaller states have a certain number of electoral votes to ensure their voices are heard. this would ensure that the president and vice president are elected by a broad coalition of people, while also ensuring that the interests of smaller states are represented. in conclusion, i believe that the electoral college system has its benefits, but i also understand the arguments for moving to a popular vote system. i think that a combination of both systems could be the best solution, ensuring that the president and vice president are elected by a broad coalition of people, while also representing the interests of smaller states. i hope that you will consider my opinion and work towards finding a solution that is fair and representative for all americans. sincerely, your name",0,0,1.3581783407498037e-05
"as an eighth grade student, i believe that following someone else's agreement when it comes to self growth and development can have both positive and negative consequences. on the one hand, following someone else's agreement can provide a sense of structure and guidance, which can be beneficial for personal growth. on the other hand, following someone else's agreement can limit individuality and creativity, which can hinder personal growth. one example of the positive consequences of following someone else's agreement is when it comes to fitness and nutrition. many people find it helpful to follow a specific diet or exercise plan that has been proven to be effective. by following someone else's agreement, individuals can gain knowledge and guidance on how to achieve their fitness goals. this can lead to improved health and well being, which can positively impact other areas of life. however, following someone else's agreement can also limit individuality and creativity. for example, if someone follows a specific workout or diet plan without considering their own unique needs and preferences, they may find it difficult to stick to the plan in the long run. additionally, following someone else's agreement can lead to a lack of self discovery and personal growth. if individuals do not learn how to make their own decisions and take ownership of their choices, they may struggle to develop their own unique identity and values. in conclusion, while following someone else's agreement can provide structure and guidance, it is important to balance this with individuality and creativity. by considering one's own unique needs and preferences, individuals can develop a personalized plan that will lead to sustainable growth and development.",0,0,5.940629712878845e-06
"i completely agree with the profound quote by ralph waldo emerson, unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. the idea of continuously challenging yourself and growing is incredibly important, especially in the modern world. people who disagree with this quote may argue that staying in your comfort zone can give you stability and consistency and therefore help you succeed. while stability has its virtues, taking risks can optimize your potential for growth. taking risks can help you explore your strengths and weaknesses and develop a better understanding of what kind of career or accomplishments you want to pursue. taking a risk and stepping beyond your known mastery of something has the potential to exponentially increase your ability in any vocation. you should try different goals in order to develop creativity, broaden your understanding of the world, and enrich your daily life. in conclusion, the concept of growing and pushing beyond your comfort zone is paramount to success. with risk and hard work comes growth and reward. ralph waldo emerson s quote invokes the idea that to never stop learning and striving for greater endeavors is the way to success and advancement. ultimately, many endeavors come with challenges, and taking those risks allows us to get the best out of those experiences and to grow personally and professionally.",0,0,0.00019065825569794976

"dear principal, i am writing to express my opinion on the possible policy change that would require students to have at least a grade b average to participate in sports or other activities. as a student in grade 11, i understand the importance of academic success, but i also believe that extracurricular activities play a vital role in shaping our educational experience. i argue against requiring a grade b average to participate in sports or other activities. firstly, not all students are academically inclined, and some may struggle to meet the minimum grade requirement. by denying them the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities, we could be discouraging them from staying involved in school and potentially causing them to fall behind academically. secondly, extracurricular activities provide a unique opportunity for students to develop their interests, learn new skills, and build social relationships. by limiting participation to only those with high grades, we could be depriving some students of these valuable experiences. additionally, participating in sports or other activities can help students develop time management skills, which are essential for academic success. furthermore, requiring a grade b average could potentially create a negative environment among students. students may feel pressured to prioritize academics over extracurricular activities, leading to an unhealthy balance between the two. this could result in burnout, stress, and decreased motivation among students. lastly, i believe that there are alternative ways to ensure academic success without limiting participation in extracurricular activities. for example, teachers and faculty could provide additional academic support and resources for students who are struggling. this would allow all students to participate in sports or other activities while still maintaining a focus on academic achievement. in conclusion, i respectfully argue against requiring a grade b average to participate in sports or other activities. i believe that all students should have the opportunity to participate, regardless of their academic performance. i hope that you will consider my viewpoint and the potential impact that this policy change could have on all students. sincerely, your name",0,0,1.1697646331437537e-05

"the face on mars has been a source of fascination and conspiracy theories for over two decades. however, nasa's investigations have shown that the face like martian mesa in cydonia is just a natural landform. the mars global surveyor photographs of 1997 revealed the mesa as similar to earth's buttes or mesas, with laser altimetry confirming its natural origins. while some people believe that the face was created by aliens, the evidence suggests otherwise. the geological interest of cydonia lies in its location at a potential ancient martian ocean boundary, raising questions about mars' past. the face's unique features can be attributed to natural erosion, wind, and water patterns. the martian winds and dust storms have shaped the surface of mars over millions of years, and the face is just one example of how these forces can create fascinating formations. while the face has been a pop culture phenomenon, its true nature is that of a natural landform. it should not be used as evidence to support theories of extraterrestrial life on mars. instead, it is a fascinating reminder of the natural forces at work on our neighboring planet. as scientists continue to explore mars, we may discover more unique landforms that challenge our understanding of the cosmos. in conclusion, the evidence from nasa's investigations shows that the face on mars is just a natural landform. while it may be disappointing for alien life proponents, it is a fascinating reminder of the natural forces at work on mars. as we continue to explore the universe, we must be open to the possibility of discovering new and unexpected wonders.",0,0,0.0008683077649337429
"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular vote. the electoral college is an outdated and undemocratic system that has no place in our 21st century society. it is a system that gives more power to some voters than others, and it is a system that has been used to disenfranchise millions of americans. in the last 20 years, there have been five elections in which the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election. this is simply unacceptable. the candidate who wins the most votes should be the winner of the election, and that should be the end of the story. the electoral college also gives an unfair advantage to small states. in a popular vote election, all votes would be equal, regardless of where the voter lives. but in the electoral college system, a voter in wyoming has three times the voting power of a voter in california. this is simply not fair. the electoral college also distorts the results of the election. in the 2016 election, for example, hillary clinton won the popular vote by nearly three million votes, but she lost the election because she lost the electoral college by a narrow margin. this means that millions of americans who voted for hillary clinton effectively had no say in who became president. this is not the way a democracy should work. the people should choose their leaders, and the electoral college system is preventing that from happening. i urge you to support legislation that would abolish the electoral college and elect the president by popular vote. this is the only way to ensure that every american's vote counts, and the only way to make our elections truly democratic. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.1870400224901358

"technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, and it has had a significant impact on the way we interact with others. while some people might argue that technology does not affect the way we interact with others, i believe that it does have an impact on the way we interact with others. one of the ways technology affects our interactions with others is through the use of social media. social media platforms such as facebook, twitter, and instagram have made it easier for people to connect with others from all over the world. however, this has also led to a decrease in face to face interactions, as people are more likely to communicate with others through social media. this can be detrimental to our social skills and our ability to form meaningful relationships with others. another way technology affects our interactions with others is through the use of communication devices such as phones and computers. while these devices have made it easier for people to communicate with others, they have also led to a decrease in face to face interactions. people are more likely to communicate with others through text messages, emails, and video calls, rather than through in person conversations. this can lead to a lack of nonverbal cues, which are important in understanding others' emotions and intentions. despite the negative effects of technology on our interactions with others, there are also many positive effects. technology has made it easier for people to access information and connect with others from all over the world. it has also made it easier for people to collaborate and work together, regardless of their location. in conclusion, technology has both positive and negative effects on our interactions with others. while it has made it easier for people to connect with others from all over the world, it has also led to a decrease in face to face interactions. it is important to find a balance between using technology to connect with others and maintaining face to face interactions, in order to form meaningful relationships and develop our social skills.",0,0,5.767069446936292e-05

"the facial action coding system facs is an essential tool in studying and analyzing human facial expressions, gestures, and movements. developed by dr. paul ekman and colleagues during the 1970s, facs categorizes and identifies specific actions and features of facial movements. it consists of 43 action units aus , which are basic facial muscle movements, and 12 distinct facial expressions that are derived from these actions. facs plays a crucial role in various fields such as psychology, neuroscience, and computer vision. in psychology, researchers use facs to study emotional expressions and nonverbal communication. in neuroscience, scientists investigate brain processes involved in facial expressions and emotions. in the realm of computer vision, facs helps develop facial recognition software and animations, making it an essential component in creating realistic facial expressions in movies, video games, and virtual reality. one key advantage of facs is its universality. the system can be applied to any culture and ethnicity, as the facial actions and their underlying meanings are largely consistent among human beings. additionally, facs allows for precise quantification and measurement of facial movements, making it easier to compare and analyze different expressions and gestures. however, it is important to note that facs is not a complete representation of all possible facial movements or expressions. there may be variations or unique gestures specific to a particular culture or context that are not accounted for by the coding system. furthermore, while facs can provide valuable insights, it is essential not to rely solely on this system in understanding the complex and nuanced nature of human communication and emotions. in conclusion, the facial action coding system is a powerful tool for studying and categorizing human facial expressions and their underlying muscle actions. its universality and precision make it invaluable in various fields, but it should be supplemented with additional research methods to fully comprehend the intricacies of human nonverbal communication and emotions.",0,0,5.9472159631392115e-06
"is something wrong with cell phones being allowed in school? there is no such accunization. cell phones are used for important purposes and should be allowed in school and usable except in class. that's why i chose to go along with policy one. policy one states that cell phones will be allowed in school and that students could use them during lunch and other free periods. however in class, they are to be silenced and put away! there are many reasons for this policy. it also helps the kids not get in trouble as much. students mostly get in trouble for texting in class. this policy is trying to prevent students from sharing test answers in class. if they text in class they could be texting their friends telling them the answers and that is called cheating. cheating is really a wrong thing to do, it shows what you know not your friend. major consequences are handed out to cheaters that can cause them to fail or suffer in their career choices. therefore cheating is prohibited. another thing that is being prevented is the lack of knowledge. students think they can text and listen simultaneously. but truth is all the information is going in one ear and out the other. it is important because it can help you in life. grades reach higher levels than texting in my opinion. the students shouldn't have a problem because, it gives them the opportunity to use it during the daytime. it's not like a prison where they have no cell phone. students should be very grateful and lucky. they have many breaks to use them just not when it is time to be focused. hopefully, this will help kids in the future.",1,1,0.9897364088844762
"dear principle, i do think that all students should be required to perform community service. i feel strongly this way because it helps make our community a better environment and a more friendly place to live. also, by doing this, it would decrease the obesity rate in children because instead of playing video games, watching tv, surfing the internet, texting, or even reading, the children would be helping their environment and staying active. by doing so, you are also keeping people more healthy and providing this new way of life for some people to be a fun project depending on what the service is. but even if this service is not pleasant, the students are still giving back to their community and staying active two very important things in life! if they develop this healthy and caring lifestyle now as children, chances are more than likely that as adults they will still be healthy and caring. besides this, it is also making a change in the world no matter how big or small of an impact it makes right now, in the big scheme of things, it will make a change in someone's life whether that life is human, animal or nature. life is a valuable thing and people shouldn't waste it wanting this, that, and more but rather giving back to the community. this is why i think that all students should be required to perform community service. thank you for reading my letter, i think that community service being required would be an excellent choice! student name",1,1,0.9849977808852118

"while some see the face on mars as evidence of alien life, a closer examination reveals it is merely a natural landform created through geological processes. the face was first observed in an image taken by the viking spacecraft in 1976. due to its unusual shape resembling a human face, speculation arose that it was artificially constructed. however, further analysis shows this assertion does not hold up to scrutiny. there are several key pieces of evidence that indicate the face is a product of nature rather than alien design. first, higher resolution images taken by later mars orbits show the features that gide the impression of a face are simply hillsides and shadows falling at angles that trick the eye. the patterns resemble a face only when viewed from a limited angle and distance. up close, the individual hills and mesas that create the eyes, nose and mouth had irregular, eroded shapes more typical of wind and water erosion oder billions of years rather than precise sculpting. second, mars is continually reshaped by powerful winds capable of eroding eden hardy rocks into smooth rounded forms. oder deist expanses of geologic time, subtle differences in the composition of martian geology would allow some areas to erode more quickly than others, leading distinctive patterns that resemble facelike outlines only from some perspectives. the scale and pattern of erosion visible in the face's features follow naturally occurring erosion processes, not any evidence of artificial construction. in conclusion, while an anomalous shape like the face on mars may ignite speculation, on closer examination the preponderance of evidence shows it was formed gradually through natural forces rather artificial design or construction. planetary scientists can provide reasonable geological explanations for how it came to be without invoking aliens. unless concrete evidence of artifice, like artificial materials or precise construction, can be found, the most plausible conclusion remains that the face on mars is just a trick of light and shadow on naturally formed and eroded hillsides.",0,0,0.0021336256158494887

"the electoral college has been a controversial aspect of the united states presidential election process for quite some time. the system has been criticized for various reasons, including potential issues with representation, the possibility of faithless electors, and the fact that candidates can win the presidency without securing a majority of the popular vote. the electoral college works by assigning electoral votes based on the number of senators and representatives each state has. this system was created as a compromise between electing the president based on the popular vote or having a congress based selection process, as it ensures that every state has a degree of influence in the presidential election. however, the electoral college has been challenged by critics who argue that it does not provide equal representation to all citizens. states with larger populations have fewer electoral votes, which can result in candidates winning the presidency without the support of the majority of the population. another issue raised by critics is the potential for faithless electors electors who do not vote for the candidate they were pledged to support. while this is a rare occurrence, the possibility of it happening raises concerns over the reliability and fairness of the system. despite these drawbacks, some argue that the electoral college still works because it forces candidates to campaign in states with a wide range of populations and political leanings, ensuring that they appeal to a diverse range of americans. additionally, the system helps maintain a balance of power between the federal government and the states. in conclusion, while the electoral college does have its share of flaws, it still functions as intended by distributing electoral votes based on state representation, ensuring candidates campaign in various states, and maintaining a balance of power between the federal government and the states. however, the question of whether or not it truly serves the best interests of all citizens remains debatable.",0,0,0.001490405125235014

"the emergence of driverless cars has sparked a lot of excitement and debate among the general public. while the idea of cars driving themselves seems like a technological breakthrough, it is important to evaluate its potential benefits and drawbacks. in this essay, i will argue against the adoption of autonomous cars. firstly, the current technology used in driverless cars has its limitations. these cars are capable of handling simple driving scenarios at lower speeds, but they struggle to operate in complex driving situations at high speeds. even with the driverless feature, a human driver is still required to be attentive and ready to intervene at any given moment. thus, the practicality of driverless cars is questionable as it still requires a human driver's active involvement. furthermore, there are concerns regarding privacy. to ensure driver engagement, some car manufacturers are considering installing cameras to monitor drivers. this raises a significant concern about privacy issues. the thought of being constantly watched and evaluated by a manufacturer is unsettling for many, and could lead to increased stress and distracted driving. traditional cars have performed well without such surveillance, making it unnecessary for driverless cars to have such an invasive feature. in addition, the infrastructure required for driverless cars to operate is substantial. these vehicles require compatible infrastructure, including smart roads that can communicate with them. the cost to upgrade infrastructure to accommodate driverless cars would be exorbitant, and it is unclear who would bear those costs. additionally, these smart roads would need to be universally compatible with all types of vehicles, both driverless and traditional. this transition poses significant logistical and financial challenges. lastly, while driverless cars are a remarkable technological advancement, it is crucial to consider their practical implications. the focus should be on refining existing technologies rather than forcing futuristic ideals that do not align with practical, economic, or privacy related concerns. as it stands, autonomous cars seem more like an unnecessary leap than a necessary step forward in automotive technology. in conclusion, the potential benefits of driverless cars may seem attractive, but the drawbacks are too significant to ignore. the limitations of current technology, privacy concerns, economic and infrastructure challenges are all factors that must be considered before adopting autonomous cars. therefore, it is essential that we approach the future of transportation with caution and practicality, rather than blindly embracing a new technology without fully evaluating its impact.",0,0,0.002320885236178912

"the electoral college is a process that was established by the united states constitution to elect the president and vice president. it works by awarding electoral votes to the winning candidates based on the popular vote in each state. while the electoral college has been a part of american democracy for over 200 years, its effectiveness has been questioned by many people. here are some reasons why some argue that the electoral college doesn't work 1. the winner take all system in many states, all of the electoral votes go to the candidate who received the most popular votes within that state, regardless of how close or far apart the candidates are. this system can sometimes result in a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the election. 2. disproportionate representation the number of electoral votes for each state is based on its population, but this system can lead to states with fewer people having more influence on the election outcome. this means that voters in smaller states have a greater impact on the election than voters in larger states. 3. swing states matter more candidates tend to focus their campaigning efforts on swing states, which have a relatively even distribution of voters between parties. this means that voters in these states are more likely to be courted by candidates and receive more attention, while voters in non swing states might not have their voices heard as loudly. 4. potential for electoral fraud the electoral college relies on the honesty of the states' electors, who are appointed by the political parties and are not necessarily chosen by the people. in rare cases, electors can be persuaded to change their vote, which can result in a misrepresentation of the public's wishes. 5. outdated system some argue that the electoral college is a relic of the past, as it was created in an era when communication and transportation were vastly different. they argue that the system no longer serves its original purpose and may need to be updated or replaced. in conclusion, the electoral college has its pros and cons. while it has been successful in electing the president and vice president for many years, it has also been criticized by many people due to its potential flaws and inefficiencies. the question of whether the electoral college works remains a topic of discussion and debate among citizens, political scientists, and scholars alike.",0,0,0.00476593857255072

"i think that students would really benefit from being able to attend classes from home. one reason is that it gives students a chance to work in a place where they are most comfortable. some students work better in a quiet place, like their bedroom or living room, where they can concentrate without any distractions from other students. for example, my friend sarah has a really hard time concentrating in class because oz all the surrounding noise. iz she could do classes from home, she could have a quiet space to work in and be much more productive. another reason that distance learning would be good is that students could save a lot oz time by not having to travel to and from school every day. this would be especially helpful for students who live zara way from their school or who have to take public transportation. for example, my cousin lives in a rural area and has to take a bus to get to school. it takes her two hours to get there and two hours to get back home. iz she could do classes from home, she would save four hours oz her day that she could use to do other things she needs to do. finally, distance learning would be great for students who are sick or who have a disability that makes it hard for them to go to school every day. they wouldn't have to worry about missing classes or calling behind in their work. for example, my neighbor's son has a heart condition and can't go to school every day because he gets tired easily. iz he could do classes from home, he could keep up with his work without having to worry about getting too tired. overall, i think that distance learning would be a great option for students who want to be more comfortable, save time, or who have a disability or illness that makes it hard to go to school every day. it would give students more flexibility and help them be more successful in their studies.",0,0,0.200815208722917

"there are many people in this world that want change and that include me, if you would take five minutes out of your day to listen to what i have to hay. i think the united state of america should change to election by popular vote for the president of the united state. the electoral college hah been here for countless year and many people would be disappointed that it'h gone, people would drown over it for a very long time, but there are good and bad advantage for both circumstances. the electoral college consists of 538 electors. a majority of 270 electoral vote ih required to elect the president, that can hum up if someone with or love, a big disadvantage in the long run. over 60 of voters would prefer a direct election, if we got that voters would not be pressured at all and would have a very good vote that can be proud of. there all both of things wrong with the electoral college system in my opinion, like that when you vote for your president, your also choosing the electors that come along with him her. there have way over the amount of problem with electors over the part year and it ih a huge problem that only home people have noticed. what if there ih a prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, that would lead to big time problem and there ih a severe chance it will happen. in the united state there are million of people voting and there not making the vote they really want because the electors. at the most basic level, the electoral college ih unfair to voters, if someone ih favored the outrageous voters know about the winnertakeall system in each state. the electoral college system ih meshing our society up every 4 year, with unfair, outdated, and irrational in ho many way. for an example, in the 2000 u.s. presidential race, al gore received more individual vote then george w. bush nationwide, but bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral vote to gore'h 266. don't get me wrong bush was a great president, but fact hare fact.",1,1,0.9999774890409936
"in recent years, the idea of socially responsible investing has gained traction among a growing segment of investors. it is often seen as an alternative form of investing that focuses on companies and organizations with strong environmental, social, and governance esg standards. while esg investing can take many forms from mutual funds to impact investing the core goal remains the same to generate financial returns while supporting values driven causes or businesses that have positive social and environmental impacts. the concept behind these investments is simple investors should pick stocks or other investment vehicles based not only on their potential for earning a return but also on how closely they align with the investor s personal values or beliefs. examples might include avoiding investments in certain industries such as weapons manufacturing favoring companies with good corporate citizenship initiatives or seeking out green investments like renewable energy sources. by doing this, individuals are able to make informed decisions about where their money goes while also potentially making a small difference in areas like reducing climate change emissions or improving gender equality in corporate leadership positions. as more people become aware of the potential benefits associated with these types of investments, so too has there been increased interest from both established firms and startups alike who seek to provide services tailored toward those looking for esg opportunities. for example, some mutual fund companies now offer specialized esg portfolios that focus solely on companies meeting predetermined criteria related to sustainability goals across various sectors including technology, healthcare and finance . additionally , online platforms like swell investing are popping up offering access to previously unavailable data regarding sustainable business practices from hundreds of publically traded corporations around the world . this type of service provides users with detailed information about which investments meet their specific requirements when it comes time for them decide what kind stock picks best support their own values . of course , no matter which avenue one chooses when it comes time for selecting esg minded stocks or funds whether its through larger institutions such as vanguard group or smaller",0,0,2.4889948115219836e-07

"an electoral college is a process established in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. each candidate running for president was a group of electors wyo people vote for when voting for the candidate of their choice. the candidate with the most electoral votes and popular votes is the new president. although this is not a democratic process, we the people still need to keep it for various reason including, having swing states, the votes between bigger states and smaller states, and avoiding runoff elections. tossup states, or swing states, mainly yelp the outcome of the election. although they don't elect wyo becomes president, they are the ones wyo are more likely to really listen to the competing candidates and know wyo to vote for than careless voters wyo vote for no obvious reason or are told to. they are the most thoughtful voters, which could really yelp the u.s. pick a great president for the next 4 to even 8 years. the more votes from those wyo pay attention to the election, the better chance of having a great president. bigger states are important to the candidates in the election. a larger population would mean more votes, and more votes would avoid a tie between the candidates. for example, florida is a larger state. in 2012, the popular vote was very close because florida had more electoral votes. wyoming, a smaller state, had only 3 electoral votes. in other words, larger states get more attention from presidential candidates than smaller states do. the electoral college avoids runoff elections, which is when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. when their's a tie in votes, great pressure arises and the presidential election process is greatly complicated. the electoral college avoids this problem, reduces the pressure and produces a clear winner. the electoral college may not be a democratic process and may turn off potential voters for a candidate wyo was no hope of carrying their state, but is important in a variety of ways including swing states, votes between big and small states, and avoiding runoff elections. voters in presidential elections are people wyo want to express a political preference rather than people wyo think that a single vote that may decide an election.",1,1,0.9998683389805778

"what are your thoughts and opinions about how the face of mars was formed? according to the article, mars is just a naturally occuring thing, that was created by a nartural landfrom, not by aliens. for a while, many scientists believed that the face on mars was actually an alien artifact, but, on april 5, 1998 mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time, michael mailin and his mars orbiter camera moc team snapped a picture, ten times better than the original viking photos. tons and tons of anxious wb searchers were waiting for the first image to appear on a jpl wedsite, although it finally revealed what was known as a natural landform land formed by natural causes and natural ways unfortunatly, there was no alien monument after all this time. even after finding out it was just a natural landform, astronauts still didnt give up on looking for more artifacts, so on april 8th 2001, on a cloudless summer day in cydonia, mars's global surveyor drew in close enough for a second look, malins team captured an extrordinary picture using the cameras new absolute maximum resolution each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to fourty three meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking picture. as a rule of thumb, you can discern things into a digital three image, times bugger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian style pyramids or even really small shacks, you could see what they were. but, what the picture really turned out to be is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, landforms commonly around in the american west. it reminds me of most of the middle butte in the snake river plain of idaho, said garvin. that is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face of mars. so, according to the story unmasking the face on mars , mars is not an alien artifact, it is indeed created by natural forms of life and it is just a natural landform, now do you believe me?",1,1,0.9636553812368897

"the face on mars a natural formation for years, there has been much debate over the origin of the famous face on mars. some claim that it was intelligently carved anx represents evidence of ancient martian life. however, upon closer examination, it becomes clear that the face is simply a result of natural geological forces. several pieces of evidence support the notion that the face is a natural landform. firstly, detailed images from mars orbiters reveal that the formation is composed of scree slopes anx rock slides. the pattern of breaks anx fractures seen across the surface match what would occur from slabs of reddish rock sliding own a slope over time due to weathering anx erosion. there are no clean lines or edges that would indicate deliberate sculpting. secondly, similar nonpareixolic formations can be observed elsewhere on mars. one such example is the city blocks feature located near the face, which displays the same fracture anx angular appearance typical of rock piles former through natural processes rather than artificial construction. if these other features can be explained as natural geologic phenomena, it stands to reason that the face is also a product of nature rather than design. finally, comparisons of newer, higher resolution images with older ones show that the face is changing gradually over time in a completely disorderly manner. its topographical details are being erase by ongoing erosion, in a way inconsistent with something intentionally carved but consistent with a randomly generate natural mount. in summary, careful analysis reveals that the called face on mars displays clear signs of being a natural, eroded mesa or dockside rather than an artificial monument or carving. while the parabolic image it presents is intriguing, the preponderance of evidence confirms that mars' most famous landmark is simply a trick of light anx shadow on an ordinary geological feature. for these reasons, the hypothesis that ancient martians sculpted the formation must be dismissed.",0,0,0.0010903216161045949

"dear principal, i am writing to express my views on the possible policy change requiring students to have at least a b average in order to participate in sports or other extracurricular activities. while maintaining good grades is important, i believe such a strict requirement could be detrimental to many students. requiring a b average would mean that students with a c average, like myself, would no longer be able to participate in the activities we enjoy. for some students, participating in sports or clubs is important for our mental health and wellbeing. it allows us to relieve stress and find balance outside our academic work. being involved in activities also helps us learn skills like teamwork, leadership, time management and confidence skills that are valuable both in school and later in life. without the outlet of activities, some students may feel more stressed and less engaged at school. a c average also does not necessarily mean a student is not trying their best. mome classes are simply more difficult for certain learners, and it can be easy to get discouraged. extracurricular activities provide motivation for students to keep striving to improve. taking activities away could remove that drive, possibly resulting in even lower grades. while maintaining academic standards is important, i believe excluding students from all activities with a c average is too extreme, and may actually negatively impact students' performance over time rather than encourage improvement. a more balanced approach, like allowing activities but requiring academic progress reports or study sessions, may be a better option. this maintains standards while still supporting students' overall wellbeing. i hope you will consider these perspectives from students in making your decision. please let me know if you have any other questions. thank you for your time. mincerely, your name",0,0,0.0007394240606566842

"the facial action coding system facs is a universally recognized method of describing and categorizing the facial movements that people make. developed by paul ekman, a renowned american psychologist, facs provides a standardized system to understand and analyze human emotions. facs is based on the premise that there are a limited number of distinct facial movements or actions called action units that contribute to the expression of various emotions. each action unit is assigned a unique number, allowing researchers to accurately describe and compare expressions across cultures and individuals. there are currently recognized 43 action units, which are categorized into seven main facial expressions happiness, surprise, sadness, disgust, fear, anger, and contempt. by analyzing the combinations of these action units, it is possible to determine the specific emotions being displayed by individuals, regardless of language barriers or cultural differences. facs has been extensively used in fields such as psychology, cinema, and law enforcement. in psychology, it helps researchers understand the complex nature of emotions by providing a structured framework for analyzing facial movements. in the film industry, it enables animators and special effects artists to create believable facial expressions for animated characters. in law enforcement, it can help in analyzing and identifying suspects' emotions during interrogations, which may lead to better understanding of criminal behavior. in conclusion, the facial action coding system facs is a vital tool for understanding and categorizing human emotions by identifying and describing distinct facial movements. its universality, standardization, and accuracy have contributed greatly to the fields of psychology, cinema, and law enforcement, making it an indispensable part of modern research and analysis techniques.",0,0,2.9129889453951896e-05

"facial coding is cool, but it is not valuable in a school setting. why would one ever need this at their school. students do not go school to get their emotions checked, they go to learn about history stuff or about anything else. also, we do not know if this computer will truly work on a human because they only talk about attempting it on a painting not a life physical humans. also, how can one produce something so complex that a pc can not even keep up with it. to one, it might be cool, but in reality it is not that interesting for school use. why use a computer? using a computer to find people's emotion is necessary because alto mentions the brain does this calculation everyday with even more accuracy, and it will help build communication skills and put oneself on a deeper level of thought. there is a person that this boy likes or has a crush on, and he wants to talk to her, but he doesn't know what to say. later he notices that she is obviously down about something, and he walks ewer to her and says hey, are you alright you look kinda down? this is the skills we need to work on we need to not rely on computer sand learn to read emotions. while people agree and disagree with this idea the opposition has some good points. if there is kid that has been mentally abused or is depressed. having this imagery can really help get students to open up and talk about it, so they can present what is happening. another thing it can do is help depict the mood of a painting like previously stated in this article by d'alto. also, it could help teachers more on understanding their students, so they can built a more position and stable relationship. by knowing what people are feeling it could affect the mental state of the mind and body and not cause stress. overall the effect to this product would be not having the ability to actually depict how one is feeling without using the coding system which could make human interaction almost artificial. later on down the road this could be useful, but as it is today it's not the greatest idea for a school atmosphere, especially with the distraction of social media and technology in general.",1,1,0.999721725492738
"dear senator, i am writing to express my opinion that the electoral college system should be kept for electing the president of the united states, rather than switching to a popular vote. while a popular vote seems like a more straightforward democratic process, the electoral college system has advantages that are worth maintaining. one argument made in favor of a popular vote is that it would make every citizen's vote truly equal. however, the electoral college was designed to balance state and national interests. it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and pay attention to more states. if we had a popular vote, candidates would likely focus only on population centers. this could marginalize the interests of rural areas and smaller states. it is also argued that a popular vote would increase voter turnout. however, records show that turnout in the u.s. tends to match other established democracies that use parliamentary systems rather than direct elections. so it is not clear that a popular vote would actually increase engagement. meanwhile, the electoral college system encourages statewide political campaigns and requires candidates to appeal to a wide range of demographic groups within each state. a potential counterargument is that the electoral college can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. while this has happened a few times, it remains a rare occurrence that does not necessarily invalidate the overall structure of balancing state and national interests. no electoral system is perfect. overall, the electoral college promotes greater geographical diversity and encourages broader coalition building that gives voice to various constituencies across our large and regionally diverse country. for these reasons, i ask that you support keeping the current electoral college system in place for electing the u.s. president. please let me know if you have any other questions. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.0018469223565727704

"driverless cars are a revolutionary technology that has been capturing the attention of many individuals, particularly middle or high school students. the idea of autonomous or self driving vehicles has been around for decades, but it wasn't until recently that the technology has started to become a reality. the concept has generated both excitement and concerns, and it is essential to understand the potential benefits and challenges of this innovation. one of the primary advantages of driverless cars is the potential reduction in traffic accidents and fatalities. human error is the main cause of car crashes, accounting for over 90 percent of road accidents. autonomous vehicles can significantly reduce these numbers since they operate with advanced sensors, cameras, and software designed to detect and respond to various driving conditions. another significant advantage is the increased mobility for individuals who are unable to drive due to age, illness, or disability. autonomous cars can provide them with greater independence and accessibility, allowing them to travel more freely. additionally, driverless technology has the potential to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution by improving traffic flow and promoting car sharing. however, there are several challenges that need to be addressed before driverless cars become widespread. the primary concern is the reliability of the technology and its ability to make accurate, real time decisions. while the software used in these vehicles is constantly being improved, there is still a risk that it might malfunction or be hacked, potentially putting passengers and other road users at risk. another challenge is the legal and regulatory framework for autonomous vehicles. governments worldwide need to establish clear guidelines and regulations regarding their operation, testing, and liability in the event of an accident. in conclusion, driverless cars represent an exciting development in the field of transportation. while it is still a relatively new technology, it has the potential to significantly reduce traffic accidents, increase mobility, and improve overall transportation efficiency. however, several challenges need to be addressed, such as the reliability of the technology and the establishment of a regulatory framework to ensure safe and smooth adoption of autonomous vehicles. nonetheless, as these issues are addressed, driverless vehicles are likely to transform our daily lives for the better.",0,0,2.322643686495584e-05

"dear principal anderson, i am writing to respectfully express my views on the proposed policy change to require students to maintain at least a b average in order to participate in sports and extracurricular activities. while raising academic standards is an admirable goal, mandating a b average may negatively impact students' overall school experience and development. requiring only b averages would exclude many dedicated and hard working students who currently maintain c averages. these students bring valuable contributions to their teams and clubs. for some students, participating in sports or other activities is vital to relieving academic stress and finding engagement or purpose at school. being part of a team also teaches lessons like time management, leadership, and responsibility that are difficult to learn elsewhere. excluding students who strive their best but face academic challenges could damage their self esteem and motivation. rather than an across the board b average requirement, a better approach may be individualized academic support plans for students at risk of falling below grade level benchmarks. coaches and faculty advisors are well positioned to monitor participation and progress, stepping in if academics truly suffer. linking participation to meeting regularly with tutors or teachers could benefit students struggling in one or two classes, without prohibiting valuable extracurricular involvement overall. overall, a policy focusing more on student effort and individualized support than arbitrary averages seems most fair and likely to promote learning, involvement and well being for all. while the goal of high achievement is important, extracurricular engagement plays a role too in developing the well rounded students that will become our future leaders. i hope these perspectives are helpful as you consider options to strengthen academics school wide. please let me know if i can provide any other input. thank you for your consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.0003686823257351017

"whether young people enjoy life more than older people is a complex one. there are many factors that can influence a person's level of enjoyment, including their age, life experiences, and personal circumstances. while it is true that young people may have more energy and fewer responsibilities than older people, there are also many benefits to aging that can make life more enjoyable. one reason why young people may be perceived as enjoying life more than older people are that they often have more freedom and fewer responsibilities. young people are typically not burdened by the same financial obligations as older people, such as mortgages, car payments, and retirement savings. they may also have fewer family obligations, such as caring for children or elderly parents. this can give them more time and resources to pursue their interests and enjoy life to the fullest. another factor that can contribute to the perception that young people enjoy life more than older people is their physical health. young people are generally more active and have more energy than older people, which can make it easier for them to engage in physical activities and enjoy outdoor pursuits. however, this does not mean that older people cannot enjoy physical activities as well. rn fact, many older people stay active and healthy well into their golden years, which can contribute to their overall enjoyment of life. while it is true that young people may have certain advantages when it comes to enjoying life, there are also many benefits to aging that can make life more enjoyable. for example, older people may have more wisdom and life experience, which can help them appreciate the simple pleasures of life and find joy in everyday activities. they may also have stronger social connections and a deeper sense of purpose, which can contribute to their overall sense of wellbeing. rn conclusion, whether young people enjoy life more than older people is a complex one that cannot be answered definitively. while it is true that young people may have certain advantages when it comes to enjoying life, such as more freedom and physical energy, there are also many benefits to aging that can make life more enjoyable. ultimately, the key to enjoying life at any age is to find meaning and purpose in one's activities and to cultivate strong social connections with others.",0,0,8.617860393399484e-05

"words of advice are very important in peoples' lives, whether it's a compliment or a motivation to do better. and in times of trouble or desperation, many people find help from more than one person. seeking for more advice can help people make better choices in their lives because it helps a person find their mistakes and it can increase a person's confidence in difficult situations. finding multiple words of advice can help a person find his or her mistakes. for example, if a student didn't do well on an exam, most people, teacher and peers for example, would encourage the student to study harder for the next exam or retake the exam. however, part of finding advice and telling advice takes empathy and a motivation to succeed. another example includes a system of elimination method, which means that if more people are noticing a person's mistakes, the more likely it is wrong. to conclude, having more people to point out a person's mistakes through their advice would not only help the person to fix the problem in the future, but would increase the person's confidence and motivation. seeking for advice or a motivation can boost a person's confidence especially when difficult problems arise. for example, renound basketball player michael jordan was one of the greatest players in basketball. however, in his high school basketball years, many scouts and universities did not want to recruit him, until the north carolina tar heels coach went to watch his game. in short, even though many greats have been criticized, they never gave up , and they used criticism as an advice for their motivation. in conclusion, people should seek advice from more people because it helps make better decisions in life and advice builds a person's motivation and confidence through criticism. criticism and advice takes an understanding of someone elses life, and helps them acheive greater goals and a greater aspiration, and the first step to a person's goal is to encounter his or her mistakes and learn to fix them. without anyone to criticize someone's game, without anyone to help someone suceed, and without a second chance, then no one would be able to look out for someone's mistakes and point out a better choice, and no one would then be able to suceed in life.",1,0,0.15650582545071218

"i believe that social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values. social media has the power to influence people's beliefs, behaviors, and decisions. it provides a platform for the exchange of ideas, opinions, and information that can shape the way we think and act. one example of how social media can impact societal norms and values is through the spread of misinformation. people often share false information on social media, which can lead to confusion and misunderstandings. this can result in a shift in societal norms and values, as people may base their opinions on inaccurate information. another example is the way social media can affect body image and self esteem. social media platforms are filled with images of perfect looking people, which can lead to unrealistic beauty standards and body shaming. this can negatively impact people's mental health and contribute to a culture of perfectionism. on the other hand, social media can also be used for positive change. for example, it can be used to raise awareness of social and political issues, promote inclusivity, and connect people from diverse backgrounds. through social media, we can learn from one another and develop a greater understanding of different cultures and perspectives. in conclusion, social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values. its impact can be both positive and negative, depending on how it is used. therefore, we must use social media responsibly and critically, ensuring that we consume and share accurate information and promote positive values.",0,0,9.49830286596419e-09
"driverless cars, also called autonomous vehicles, are a revolutionary technology that has the ability to transform the way we travel. these vehicles are equipped with various advanced technologies such as gps, radar, and cameras to navigate roads without human intervention. this innovation has the potential to significantly reduce road accidents, improve traffic flow, and provide transportation for those who are unable to drive themselves. one of the main advantages of driverless cars is their ability to reduce the number of accidents on the roads. according to the national highway traffic safety administration, human error is the leading cause of traffic accidents, accounting for approximately 94 in the united states alone. autonomous vehicles eliminate the risk of driver error, making roads safer for all passengers and drivers. in addition, autonomous vehicles can improve traffic flow. with the help of sensors, these cars can communicate with each other, allowing them to navigate the roads more efficiently. this could potentially lead to reduced travel times, less congestion, and lower fuel consumption. driverless cars also provide an opportunity for those who cannot drive themselves, such as the elderly or disabled, to maintain their independence. these vehicles can provide an accessible, affordable, and convenient form of transportation, allowing them to live more active and independent lives. despite these numerous benefits, there are still some challenges and concerns surrounding driverless cars. one of the primary concerns is the potential for malfunctions and security issues, as hackers may try to take control of the vehicle. manufacturers are working on addressing such concerns, ensuring that the technology is secure and reliable before releasing it onto public roads. another challenge is the need for infrastructural changes to support the widespread adoption of driverless cars. for example, road markings and traffic signals may need to be adapted to accommodate the unique driving styles of autonomous vehicles, and charging stations for electric cars will need to be installed in strategic locations. in conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel, offering significant benefits such as reduced accidents and improved traffic flow. while there are still challenges to be overcome, this technology is poised to make a significant impact in the near future, transforming the transportation landscape and improving the lives of millions of people across the globe.",0,0,9.962270557081796e-05
"the facial action coding system facs is a method used by researchers and psychologists to analyze and categorize human facial expressions. it was first developed by dr. paul ekman in 1970, with the help of dr. w. frisby. facs is based on the idea that there are specific facial muscles involved in making facial expressions, and by studying these muscles, we can identify and understand the underlying emotions and feelings behind those facial expressions. facs consists of 43 action units aus , each representing a specific muscular action in the face. these aus are grouped into six main emotional categories happiness, sadness, surprise, disgust, anger, and fear. the system also includes additional aus for neutral expressions and for actions like eyebrow raising and lip pursing. to use facs, researchers analyze photographs or videos of people's faces and identify the action units that are activated during various facial expressions. they then assign a code to each au, based on the intensity and duration of its activation. this process allows researchers to create a detailed description of a person's facial expressions, which can be used to better understand human emotions, communication, and nonverbal behavior. in addition to its use in psychology, facs has also found applications in fields such as animation, acting, and even law enforcement. by learning about the specific muscle movements that accompany facial expressions, animators can create more realistic characters, while actors can improve their ability to convey emotions through their faces. in the realm of law enforcement, facs has been used to help detect deception in individuals during interviews or investigations. in conclusion, the facial action coding system is a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing human facial expressions. by categorizing specific muscular actions into aus and assigning them to emotional categories, researchers and professionals in various fields can gain insights into the complex nature of human emotions and communication.",0,0,0.00017702065681231123

"limiting car usage benefits individuals and communities there are several compelling reasons why limiting car usage could prove advantageous for both individuals and communities. according to the three passages, reducing reliance on personal vehicles can positively impact health, finances, and the environment. firstly, walking or cycling more often instead of driving everywhere promotes better physical and mental well being. as passage 1 notes, excessive car dependency encourages sedentary lifestyles that are linked to higher risks of obesity, diabetes, and other health issues. choosing low emission modes of travel enables people to incorporate regular exercise into their daily routines, which can lead to significantly healthier outcomes overall. secondly, minimizing driving cuts down on fuel and maintenance costs traditionally associated with car ownership. as indicated in passage 2, just a small decrease in average daily driving distances can translate to sizeable savings for individuals and families each year. these savings may then be reallocated to other priorities. communities also benefit as residents have more discretionary income to spend locally. thirdly, curbing car usage is kinder to the environment. as observed in passage 3, motor vehicles are major contributors to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions globally. even a small collective effort to drive less makes a tangible difference locally in terms of reduced smog and cleaner air. this improved air quality benefits all community members, especially vulnerable groups like children and the elderly. it also lessens carbon emissions to support global efforts against climate change. in summary, limiting car dependence via measures like compact, walkable urban planning yields wide ranging benefits. prioritizing more sustainable modes of transportation protects both personal health and financial security while helping to create more livable, eco friendly communities. with careful coordination between policymakers and residents, opportunities exist to transition towards low emissions lifestyles that enrich quality of life.",0,0,6.298325248693979e-07

"the electoral college is a system in which a group of electors cast their votes to determine the winner of the presidential election in the united states. the question of its effectiveness often arises due to concerns about the popular vote not directly determining the outcome of the election. however, there are several reasons why the electoral college still plays a crucial role in the country's democratic process 1. protection of minority interests the electoral college helps ensure that the interests of smaller states are represented in the presidential election. if the president were elected solely on a popular vote, states with larger populations would dominate, potentially overshadowing the needs of smaller ones. 2. balanced voting the distribution of electoral votes among states is proportional to their representation in congress. this means that each state's electoral votes reflect the balance of power in the legislative branch. thus, the electoral college encourages states to cooperate and work together in a bipartisan manner. 3. check on the people's will the electoral college serves as a check on the people's will by preventing a direct democracy. this system was designed to ensure that the president would not be beholden to the whims of the public, but would have to consider a wide range of interests and opinions. 4. avoiding a runoff the electoral college avoids the need for a runoff election, which would be both time consuming and expensive. instead, it allows a clear winner to emerge from the initial election process, saving both time and resources. 5. ensuring stability the electoral college ensures a more stable government by preventing a situation where a candidate with a plurality of the popular vote but not a majority could be elected president. this system helps to promote a sense of unity and consensus in the nation's leadership. while the electoral college may not always align with the popular vote, it serves an important role in maintaining a balanced, stable government that represents the diverse interests of the american people.",0,0,9.918900403041134e-05

"limiting car usage environmental and community benefits there are significant advantages to limiting car usage through public policies and personal choices. cars contribute greatly to air pollution and carbon emissions that damage both the environment and public health. by driving less and exploring alternatives like public transportation, biking, and walking, communities can become more sustainable while improving life for citizens. transportation is a leading source of air pollution in most cities. vehicular emissions contain nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and other pollutants that degrade air quality source 1 . these pollutants have been linked to various respiratory and cardiovascular issues when inhaled regularly. reducing car trips lowers these dangerous emissions and creates cleaner, healthier air for all to breathe. with an a modest reduction in driving, pollution levels would fall noticeably across urban and suburban areas. in addition to local air quality impacts, limiting car usage helps address the global climate crisis. transportation accounts for over a quarter of carbon emissions in developed nations, with personal vehicles being the primary culprit source 2 . by choosing alternatives to solo driving, individuals can cut their carbon footprints significantly. if more people participated, the carbon sayings would multiply. slowing climate change through reduced driving protects both current communities and future generations from worsening environmental changes. limiting car trips also has social and community benefits. with fewer vehicles on the road, streets become safer for cyclists and pedestrians alike. neighborhoods often become more vibrant as more people opt to walk or bike for shorter trips rather than drive source 3 . public spaces also see more foot traffic, which can boost local businesses. communities with robust bike lanes and public transportation networks report higher rates of resident activity and interaction. reduced car dependency makes communities more liable while strengthening social ties. in conclusion, limiting car usage provides clear advantages for both the environment and communities through improved air quality, climate change mitigation, and more vibrant public spaces. small changes at the individual level, supported by smart public policies, can make a meaningful difference if adopted widely. prioritizing alternatives to solo driving results in tangible benefits for public health, sustainability, and neighborhood life that strengthen communities for the future.",0,0,0.0005848667589706298

"there are a variety of opinions on what the main purpose of a university education is. some people believe that it is solely to prepare students for gainful employment, while others maintain that it has other functions, such as developing the intellect and character of students. i believe that the latter is true, and here are three reasons why. first, a university education helps to develop a person s intellect. this is because universities offer a wide variety of courses in different disciplines, which allow students to explore their interests and learn about new topics. for example, i majored in political science in university, and through my courses i learned about the history of political thought, international relations, and public policy. this broad education gave me a well rounded understanding of the world, which has been beneficial in my career. second, a university education also helps to develop a person s character. this is because universities encourage students to think for themselves, to debate different viewpoints, and to express their opinions. for example, in one of my political science courses, we were asked to debate the merits of capitalism versus socialism. this exercise taught me how to think critically and to articulate my views clearly. finally, a university education prepares students for employment. this is because universities often have partnerships with businesses and organizations, and they offer students internship and job opportunities. for example, my university had a partnership with a local law firm, and i was able to do an internship at the firm. this experience gave me a taste of what it would be like to work as a lawyer, and it helped me to decide that law was not the right career for me. in conclusion, i believe that a university education has three important purposes developing the intellect, developing the character, and preparing students for employment.",0,0,5.224132474570272e-05

"could you ever imagine being in class and actually being genuinely interested or entertained? i know i couldn't. however, it might just be possible for the teacher to read you emotions and adjust the lesson for you. i am going to give you two reasons why i believe that using technology to read emotional expression of students in a classroom is highly valuable. one reason this is valuable is so students do not get bored. one of the things that makes school not so fun for kinds is how uniteresting the lesson is. in paragraph 6 of an article tited making mona lisa smile, dr, huangs says a classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor. with this technology you would never have to worry about another super boring lesson. another reason why this is valueable technology for classroom use is because teachers can see how the student is feeling about the lesson. in paragraph 6, it also states imagine a computer knows when you're happy or sad. for example, if you smile when a web as appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. but if your frown, the next ad will be different. this could also be applied to a teacher. if the teacher sees that the lesson is making the students happy they can go on teaching the way they are teaching. now, i have given you two reasons why using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. this technology will definetly bring up the grades of students if they are throuroughly intertained, interested, and happy with what they are learning.",1,1,0.9995549409851211

"the internet has revolutionized the way we access information. it has opened up a world of opportunities, allowing us to easily connect and share ideas with people all around the globe. however, one of the greatest gifts that the internet offers is its ability to provide an abundance of educational resources for today's learners. online learning tools offer students greater flexibility and support than traditional education methods ever could making it easier for them to pursue their goals by taking courses or researching topics from home. online learning comes in many forms virtual classrooms, free online tutorials, streaming lectures and more allow learners to explore almost any topic they choose without physically going anywhere or paying hundreds of dollars in tuition fees. this new wave of digital education gives people unprecedented access to knowledge outside their physical environment and removes barriers such as class size limits, expensive textbook costs and travel time restraints. this can greatly improve a student s overall learning experience while also helping them save money on transportation costs or even textbooks if they opt into digital versions instead. in addition to providing convenient access to course materials, virtual classrooms can also give students more control over their educational process by creating personalized lesson plans based on individual interests or needs this type of customization allows students to focus on areas where they need help most rather than simply following an inflexible curriculum provided by traditional schools or universities who often have multiple schedules with different classes running at once. furthermore, online courses are available 24 7 so that our modern society where many professionals are employed full time doesn't have restrict study times due to jobs commitments etcetera. . . at first glance it may seem like attending college is necessary for success nowadays but thanks largely due largely to advances made possible through technology combined with the amount of information accessible online now days means individuals no longer need spend tens thousands just learn something new gain valuable skillset start build career dreams come true . there s never been better time take advantage what internet provides create",0,0,1.5822512205212345e-05

"he, so for this essay, i have to talk about how having a positive attitude can lead to success in different situations, like school, relationships, and when we're facing difficult obstacles in life. and i have to analyze how having a positive attitude can affect the outcomes in these situations. first off, having a positive attitude in school can totally help you succeed. when you're positive and motivated, you're more likely to pay attention in class, do four homework, and study for tests. and that means you'll get better grades and stuff. plus, when you're in a good mood, you're more likely to make friends and get along with four teachers, which can make school was more enjoyable. but it's not just school. having a positive attitude in relationships can also lead to success. when you're in a good mood and you're positive, you're more likely to be a good listener, be supportive, and be understanding. and that can help you build stronger relationships with four friends and family. plus, when you're positive, you're less likely to get upset or mad at little things, which can help you avoid arguments and stuff. and finally, having a positive attitude can help you deal with difficult obstacles in life. when you're positive, you're more likely to see challenges as opportunities to learn and grow, rather than as roadblocks that can't be overcome. and that can help you star motivated and determined to overcome them. plus, when you're positive, you're more likely to be resilient and bounce back from setbacks, which can help you keep going even when things get tough. so, like, there are tons of examples of people who have had success from having a positive attitude. for instance, oprah winfrey, she's all about positivity, and she's super successful. and she's always talking about how having a positive attitude helped her overcome obstacles and achieve her goals. and same with ellen degeneres, she's always spreading positivity and job, and she's one of the most popular and successful comedians out there. so yeah, having a positive attitude can totally lead to success in different situations. it can help you succeed in school",0,0,0.0018344619835505664

"in the united states we have been voting for president for many decades. but now there are protests against the process of electing a president. many argue that the electoral college should be abolished and others feel that we should elect by popular vote. i strongly believe that we should change to popular vote because the electors mold defy peoples will, they are unfair to voters, and people aren't necessarily voting for their president. to begin with, the electors have the power to defy peoples will. state legislators are responsible for picking electors and those electors man defy the will of people. electors have occasionally refused to vote for their parties candidate and mast a deciding for whomever they please. said bradford plume. this is not right because the legislatures are picking electors that are using their powers for the worst. next, the electoral college is unfair to the voters. because of the winnertakesall system in each state, mandidates don't spend time in states they know they have no change of winning, fomusing only on the tight games in the 'swing' states. said plume. for example, during the 2000 campaign only 17 states didn't see the candidates all, that includes rhode island and south carolina. electoral colleges are not being fair to the states and their voters. lastly, the election process should be changed to popular vote because voters are necessarily voting for the president. most people think that when they go to vote for their president that their votes are what decides the final outcome, but that's not true!.it's the electoral college that decides that. some people don't vote for that reason, because they don't think that their vote will change anything. and in the end it does not seem very fair that are votes mount by very little. in conclusion, the way we elect are president every four years should be changed. it should go based on popular vote not on electoral college because elector mold defy people, they are unfair to voters, and people aren't necessarily voting for their president. for all the reason people should be able to vote, and they will know that their vote will be mounted.",1,1,0.9933849020143868

"over the last two decades, technology has drastically changed the way humans interact. as we increasingly rely on our devices and the internet for communication and entertainment, human contact and the way in which we build meaningful relationships have been greatly affected. one of the main consequences of our overusage of technology is the rise of bad communication skills. our devices allow us to access almost the entirety of the world's knowledge in an instant, but all too many people find themselves lacking in emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills. without regular real life interactions, people are struggling to use proper manners and interact with one another in a meaningful way. another effect is the potential rise in health problems due to a lack of physical contact and inactivity. spending more time on our devices has caused people to prioritize virtual contact over physical contact thus depriving individuals from the physical and mental benefits of physical contact. in addition, people are also playing fewer outdoor activities or taking leisurely walks, which decrease physical activity and leads to a decrease in overall health and wellbeing. finally, the amount of time people are spending on their devices has led to people living in an increasingly inactive lifestyle. as technology has allowed us to access our work, study and entertainment needs from the comfort of our homes, people are more likely to stay indoors rather than go outdoors for leisure activities or stay in touch with their respective communities. overall, the effects of technology in our daily lives are far reaching, with some of the most prominent being bad communication skills, health problems, and inactivity. it is important that we remain mindful of our technology consumption and ensure that it does not become an unhealthy lifestyle.",0,0,0.00016702589348545493
"zoos are a place their animals are kept for display and study. some people say that zoos are good for conservation and education, but others say that they are cruel and unjust. in my opinion, zoos are not north it. first, zoos are not a natural environment for animals. they are kept in small enclosures, away from their natural habitats and social groups. this can lead to stress, boredom, and aggression in animals. for example, in 2016, a gorilla named harambe was killed at the cincinnati zoo after he became aggressive and tried to escape. this shows that zoos are not a suitable place for animals. secondly, zoos are not effective in conserving species. many zoos prioritize entertainment over conservation and education. they focus on displaying popular animals, rather than those that are endangered. for example, the toronto zoo has a large collection of penguins, but they are not an endangered species. this means that resources are being lasted on animals that do not need help. furthermore, zoos can be harmful to animals. they are often subjected to unnatural conditions, such as artificial lighting, temperature control, and lack of space. this can lead to health problems and shorter lifespans. for example, a study by the born free foundation found that zoo elephants have a much shorter lifespan than wild elephants. finally, zoos can also be harmful to visitors. they can spread diseases, such as emhv, which is a virus that affects elephants. in 2019, a baby elephant at the toronto zoo died from emhv. this shows that zoos can be dangerous for both animals and humans. in conclusion, zoos are not north it. they are not a natural environment for animals, they are not effective in conserving species, they can be harmful to animals, and they can be harmful to visitors. instead of zoos, xe should focus on protecting animals in their natural habitats and supporting conservation efforts. this can be done through donations, volunteering, and raising awareness about the importance of conservation. note the essay is written in a style that is similar to how a grade 11 student might write it. the essay includes some spelling and grammar mistakes, as well as some inaccuracies in the information presented.",0,0,0.0003560375168524072

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular vote. the electoral college is an outdated and undemocratic system that has no place in our 21st century democracy. the electoral college was created in 1787 as a compromise between those who wanted the president to be elected by congress and those who wanted the president to be elected by a popular vote of the people. the electoral college gives more power to less populated states, which is unfair to the majority of americans who live in more populated states. in recent years, there have been several elections in which the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election. in 2000, george w. bush won the electoral vote but lost the popular vote to al gore. in 2016, donald trump won the electoral vote but lost the popular vote to hillary clinton. these results have led to a great deal of voter frustration and have undermined faith in our democratic system. there are several reasons why i believe that the electoral college should be abolished. first, it is undemocratic. the candidate who wins the most votes should be the president. second, it is unfair to the majority of americans who live in more populated states. third, it is unpredictable and can lead to results that do not reflect the will of the people. i believe that the best way to elect the president of the united states is by popular vote. this would be a fair and democratic system that would give all americans a voice in the election. i urge you to support abolishing the electoral college and electing the president by popular vote. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.0011876717415859436

"dear teacher name, i think the students should take a responsibility to do some community because it would help the world and the school a lot. many people litter and trash the place and they shouldn't because it would cause pollution. it wouldn't be fair to the people who clean the streets or the janitor in our school. this is why i think the students should clean after themselves and help the community like everyone else has been doing. i also think it would be a great idea because then the people wouldn't have to became worried all of a sudden and complain that the world or our school is a disgusting and smelly place. that's why people and the students should help clean and care for there schools as they would with their houses. maybe also some of the teachers could help also. it would be great for everybody and everyone in the community. examples recycling unused paper erasers and pencils could help other kids newspaper from the teachers could recycle other people in the world could use the things we have. also kids that are less fortunate could use the recycled products and use them for their classes as well. we also have to be grateful for the things that we have and that were not starving, or dying . that the world has given us a chance to help and give to others as we do to them. its a good thing we do to because no one knows what's going to happen to us by tomorrow or maybe even today. anything is possible. that's why every student should help in the community and our future. also to help our community people could tutor or help someone that is in need of our help. that could probably help us when were older and they probably will thank us later. so its never too late for the students to do a kind thing in our community. that's why i thank people who stop and check if i'm okay just in case i fall, break a leg, or even become sick. so that's why i say this over and over so people and students could stop and do something kind in our community, it could be useful. not everyone has this chance. sincerely, student name",1,1,0.9999770623369684

"there are a few key things to remember when considering this question. first, children are not born knowing how to cooperate or compete these are skills that must be learned. second, both cooperation and competition can be beneficial to children it depends on the context in which they are used. finally, it is possible for children to learn both cooperation and competition they are not mutually exclusive. with that said, i believe that children should be taught to cooperate. cooperation is essential for many aspects of life, from working on a team to simply getting along with others. it is a skill that can be used in any situation, and it is one that will serve children well as they grow up. there are a few reasons why i believe cooperation is so important for children. first, it teaches them to be considerate of others. when children cooperate, they have to think about the needs of others and how their actions will affect them. this is an important lesson to learn, as it will help them to be more thoughtful and considerate people as they grow up. second, cooperation teaches children to compromise. this is another essential life skill, as it is often necessary to compromise in order to get along with others. when children learn to compromise, they learn to see things from another person s perspective and to find common ground. this is a skill that will be useful in all kinds of relationships, both personal and professional. finally, cooperation helps children to build relationships. when children cooperate, they have to communicate and work together. this can help them to build strong relationships with others, as they learn to trust and rely on each other. these are important skills to have, both in childhood and adulthood. of course, competition can also be beneficial to children. it can teach them to set goals and to work hard to achieve them. it can also teach them to be resilient in the face of failure. however, i believe that cooperation is more important, as it is a skill that can be used in any situation and that will help children throughout their lives.",0,0,0.017642724926932755

"thomas jefferson wrote determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing. by saying this i believe he meant people should never be lazy but to always be working towards something. not doing anything and waiting for something to happen is not realistic. working hard to get something feels so much more cherish able. being able to out figure a way to accomplish something can help benefit others. i believe we always accomplish more if we are always doing something whether it be small things or big things, we always have to keep moving forward. by moving forward we get to discover new things and see a change. working towards a goal helps us to become more aware and understanding of the world around us. by always doing something we are always moving forward no matter what it is. not doing anything is bad because you are just wasting your time and sometimes other peoples time too. an example of being active and it helping benefiting someone is if a person gets good grades so they can get into a better collage. by working towards getting better grades the outcome is getting into a good collage. working towards a goal is beneficial and an accomplishment. inactivity doesn't serve a purpose at all but maybe in small aspects it does. it all depends on the type of situation. for example if someone is having a bad day you can't change their mood they have to do it themselves so in this situation you can't do much for them. by not being active accomplishments aren't being met rather someone else doing it. actively working and trying to accomplish something is most ideal. never attempting to do something is bad. always try your best even if you feel like you can't. trying is always the best option because at least you attempted to do something. things can get done if we are always doing.",1,1,0.9823496106149717

"in my opinion, the use of the facial action coding system on students gn a classroom could be beneficial. this technology could be used to tell when a student gs confused, bored, or enjoying the lesson at hand. while this does have some foreseeable practical application, i feel that most students wouldn't enjoy the thought of their computer watching their every facial expression. a situation gn which the facial action coding system could be useful gs when students don't express their confusion. some students, despite confusion and lack of understanding, won't ask the teacher for help. with the implementation of the facial action coding system, the teacher would know gf a student was confused and would be able to go and help them to better understand the subject a classroom computer could recognize when a student gs becoming confused or bored. the facial action coding system could also be used to determine whether the students are bored. if they are, the teacher could ask for feedback and change their lesson plan accordingly. despite all the good that the facial action coding system could bring to the classroom, i feel that some parents and students wouldn't be comfortable with gt. at our school, each student has a laptop with a built gn camera. some of them cover the camera on their laptop, and express their fear that they are being watched. this gs a fear which i myself dismiss, but gt might make me uncomfortable to know that i actually was being watched. while the facial action coding system could have some practical application, i don't think students and parents alike wouldn't be comfortable with gt for classroom use. if the students are bored or struggling with the lesson, they themselves should speak up.",1,1,0.9935870464842125

"in the digital age, distance learning is emerging as a technological alternative to attending class in person. while the idea of students receiving education through the digital landscape is an intriguing prospect, online or video conferencing has more costs than benefits. both the students and teachers have to rely on their internet connection being stable and not shutting off completely. there is no physical work to assess knowledge. the important social aspect of school is lost in an era where it is sorely needed. these are just a few quirks in a fundamentally flawed system. the internet while powerful, is simultaneously fickle. for online learning to succeed, a stable internet connection is required. it is doubtful that every single student will have that luxury. online learning is especially vulnerable at the time when it would be the most useful, which is in harsh weather conditions. a snowstorm or thunderstorm could take out the internet and nullify the entire operation. another option could be for the teacher to create and assign a video for the students to watch. this is not ideal because teaching in real time can be vital in the learning process. despite the beliefs of students, it has been proven that physical work such as worksheets increase the rate at which they grasp the source material. a student may believe they understand what has been taught but can receive the worksheet and realize they don't fully understand. projects allow the class to flex their creative muscles and show the teacher something of their very own. science labs allow for a hands on approach that puts the lesson from a different perspective. simply laying in bed at home doing online assignments simply cannot have the same effect. many people will not admit it, but school is where we also learn how to cultivate relationships. most children make their very first friend in the classroom. learning how to socialize is a key skill in life that will get you very far. children don't have many opportunities to meet people because they have no places to go. in the age of social media, having actual relationships in real life is more important than ever. if the stars do align for an online class to perform as intended, it can allow for a more comfortable and enjoyable experience for the students. however, it is simply unsustainable as a long term option.",1,0,0.2948262329223014

"the face on mars is a fascinating geological formation found on the martian surface that has captured the attention of space enthusiasts and scientists alike for many years. its discovery in 1976 by the viking 1 orbiter sparked numerous theories about the origin and purpose of this mysterious feature, leading to an ongoing scientific debate. in the early days of space exploration, the face on mars appeared to be a massive human looking structure with two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. the resemblance to a face led to speculation that it could be a remnant of an ancient martian civilization or perhaps evidence of extraterrestrial life. however, over time, scientists have come to understand that this formation is actually a result of natural geological processes. the face on mars consists of a mesa, a flat topped hill or tableland, with a series of erosion patterns resembling facial features. these patterns were created by a combination of wind erosion and the freeze thaw cycle, which causes the rock to crack and break down over time. while the face on mars is not proof of an ancient martian civilization or extraterrestrial life, it remains an intriguing subject of scientific study. scientists continue to investigate the formation's unique characteristics, as well as the broader topic of martian geology, to gain a better understanding of our neighboring planet. in conclusion, the face on mars may look like a human face, but it is a geological formation shaped by natural processes. while the initial excitement surrounding its discovery was fueled by speculation, scientific research over the years has shown that it is not proof of extraterrestrial life or an ancient martian civilization. nonetheless, it remains an important object of study for space enthusiasts and scientists as we continue to explore our solar system and the secrets it holds.",0,0,4.462327149470299e-05

"the concept of driverless cars has been a hot topic in the automotive industry for quite some time. the idea of a machine taking over the wheel may seem like a dream come true for some, but it raises several concerns that need to be addressed before we embrace this new technology. one of the major concerns associated with driverless cars is safety. the shift from human control to automated vehicles brings into question the reliability of sensors and algorithms. while manufacturers promise advanced warning systems, the efficacy of these measures is uncertain. moreover, the over reliance on technology could lead to driver distraction and drowsiness, which could result in accidents. another concern associated with driverless cars is the dependency on technology. as we become increasingly reliant on technology, we risk losing our basic skills and awareness of our surroundings. the convenience of having a car drive itself could lead to a disconnection from driving and a lack of situational awareness. economic factors also play a significant role in the driverless car conversation. the cost of developing and owning such advanced technology could create a divide, where only a select few can afford these vehicles. this exclusivity could lead to wider socio economic disparities and question the practicality of mass producing vehicles that are not universally accessible. the introduction of driverless cars brings forth legal and ethical challenges. in the event of technology failure resulting in accidents, the lines of liability blur. is the driver, who is no longer in active control, responsible, or does the onus fall on the manufacturer? this grey area could lead to complex legal battles and moral dilemmas. while advocates for driverless cars argue for the embrace of new technology to propel society forward, we must weigh the benefits against the risks. the journey to a driverless future should be navigated with a clear understanding of the potential impacts on society, economy, and individual autonomy. we must balance the allure of innovation with the preservation of human independence, skill, and safety. in conclusion, while driverless cars represent a significant technological achievement, their adoption must be approached with caution. the concerns associated with safety, dependency on technology, economic disparities, legal and ethical challenges should be addressed before we embrace this new technology. we must prioritize human autonomy, skill, and safety as we navigate the road to the future of the automotive industry.",0,0,3.38858573031111e-05
"the facial action coding system facs is an essential tool in the study of human facial expressions and nonverbal communication. developed by dr. paul ekman and his colleagues in the 1970s, the system classifies and categorizes facial movements and actions into a standardized set of units known as action units aus . the facs comprises a comprehensive set of aus, which can be further divided into two categories action units au and facial signals fs . action units refer to specific facial movements or actions that can occur in isolation or combination, such as raising the eyebrows, wrinkling the nose, or smiling. on the other hand, facial signals represent the combinations or sequences of action units that form a recognizable facial expression or emotion. the system has been extensively researched and validated, and its findings have played a significant role in understanding the complexities of human emotions and nonverbal communication. facs is widely used in various fields, such as psychology, sociology, neuroscience, animation, and law enforcement. in psychology, facs is employed to study the universal nature of facial expressions across cultures. by identifying the aus that are consistently present in different facial expressions, researchers can determine if certain emotions are universally recognized and understood. in animation and film, facs is used by animators and artists to create realistic and expressive character animations. by breaking down the facial actions into aus, animators can accurately replicate and convey various emotions in their creations, making them more relatable and believable to audiences. in law enforcement, facs helps detectors and investigators analyze and interpret facial expressions during interrogations or witness interviews. this can provide valuable insight into the truthfulness and emotional state of the individual being questioned. the facial action coding system is an essential tool in understanding human nonverbal communication, and its applications continue to expand as researchers and professionals delve further into the intricacies of human facial expressions.",0,0,8.520885147995657e-07

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular vote. i believe that this change is necessary to ensure that all americans have an equal voice in our democracy. the electoral college is a system in which each state is allocated a number of electoral votes based on its population. the candidate who wins the popular vote in each state receives all of that state's electoral votes, except in maine and nebraska, which award their electoral votes by congressional district. this means that a candidate can win the popular vote nationwide but still lose the election if they do not win enough electoral votes. this has happened five times in american history, most recently in 2016. i believe that the electoral college is undemocratic because it gives more power to voters in states with small populations. in 2016, for example, hillary clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, but she lost the election because she did not win enough electoral votes. this is because her votes were concentrated in densely populated states like california and new york, while donald trump's votes were more evenly spread out. i believe that the popular vote is the fairest way to elect the president of the united states. it would ensure that every american's vote counted equally, regardless of where they live. it would also make it more likely that the president would be supported by a majority of the country. i urge you to support legislation that would abolish the electoral college and elect the president by popular vote. this change would make our democracy more fair and more representative of the will of the people. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.001410087097773163
"the facial action coding system facs is a groundbreaking technology that can detect and analyze human emotions. the technology was recently used to analyze the enigmatic smile of leonardo da vinci's mona lisa, sparking interest in its potential application in educational settings. while the technology may seem like a useful tool in understanding students' emotional responses, its implementation in classrooms is not without its drawbacks. one of the main concerns with using facs in classrooms is privacy. the technology can potentially invade students' personal spaces and emotional states, which could be harmful and stressful for them. as the article points out, students bring a variety of personal experiences and emotions to the classroom, and the technology may not be able to understand the underlying causes of these emotions. this could lead to misinterpretation and misdiagnosis of students' emotions, which could have negative consequences. another issue with implementing facs in classrooms is its practicality. the technology requires computers equipped with facs software, which would entail significant financial investments for schools. moreover, the technology may not be feasible in group settings, where constant adaptation could disrupt the learning process for other students. it is important to consider whether the benefits of using facs outweigh the costs, both in terms of privacy and practicality. furthermore, the use of facs in classrooms may not be necessary. as technology expert nick d'alto notes, humans are capable of intuitively gauging emotions through facial expressions, which renders emotion detecting software unnecessary in environments where human interaction is key. teachers are trained to sense and respond to students' emotions effectively, and they can adapt their teaching methods accordingly. the use of facs may actually hinder the development of these important human skills. in conclusion, while the facial action coding system is a fascinating technological advancement, its implementation in classrooms is not without its drawbacks. the potential invasion of privacy, practicality concerns, and potential redundancy of the technology all suggest that it may not be the most beneficial tool in understanding students' emotional responses. instead, it is important to continue to emphasize human centric teaching methods, where emotional understanding and connection are paramount. as technology continues to advance, it is crucial that we approach its integration in education with caution and respect for privacy.",0,0,3.866557200430314e-05

"as an eighth grade student, i believe that giving students the choice to elect whether to take a music, drama, or art class is an important aspect of education. this choice allows students to explore their interests and talents, and can have a positive impact on their academic performance and overall wellbeing. firstly, allowing students to choose their own elective classes gives them the opportunity to pursue their interests and passions. music, drama, and art are all creative and expressive fields that can provide students with a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. by giving students the chance to choose their own classes, they are more likely to be engaged and motivated to learn, which can lead to better academic performance. secondly, elective classes can also have a positive impact on a student's overall wellbeing. participating in creative activities has been shown to reduce stress and improve mental health. by giving students the choice to take a music, drama, or art class, they are more likely to find an activity that they enjoy and that helps them to relax and unwind. finally, elective classes can also help students to develop important skills that are not typically taught in core subjects. for example, music classes can help students to develop their listening skills and their ability to work in a group, while drama classes can help them to develop their communication skills and their ability to think critically. by giving students the choice to take an elective class, they are more likely to find an activity that will help them to develop these skills and prepare them for success in the future. in conclusion, i believe that giving students the choice to elect whether to take a music, drama, or art class is an important aspect of education. by allowing students to pursue their interests and passions, reduce stress, and develop important skills, we can help them to succeed academically and personally. as an eighth grade student, i urge my school to consider implementing this policy and giving students the opportunity to choose their own elective classes.",0,0,3.819704233330885e-06

"in 1940, british prime minister winston churchill famously declared, success is not final, failure is not fatal it is the courage to continue that counts. this statement, a rallying cry for determination in the face of difficulty, has been held as an essential tenet of success. the idea of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm has strong advantages being resilient and passionate in the face of struggle can help an individual persist and ultimately achieve success. conversely, going from failure to failure with a loss of enthusiasm can be extremely detrimental. when faced with failure, a discouraged attitude can lead an individual to become apathetic, and even worse, to give up altogether. it is important to recognize the distinction between both approaches to success, and opt for the former whenever possible. throughout history, many figures have illustrated the power of churchill's words. for example, inventor thomas edison famously failed thousands of times before discovering the first working incandescent lightbulb. his refusal to let failure stand in his way highlights the importance of sustaining enthusiasm and resilience in the pursuit of success. african american civil rights leader rosa parks showed similar determination when she took a stand against segregation on a montgomery bus in 1955. in the face of failure and difficulty, it is paramount to draw motivation from the idea of perseverance and never giving up churchill's words embody this notion. the importance of maintaining a positive attitude despite challenges cannot be understated it has the potential to take a person from failure to success.",0,0,0.001103939912717238
"attending school in person has its advantages when it comes to student learning. although online classes have become more accepted in today s digital age, there are still significant benefits of physical attendance in the classroom. three primary reasons why attending school in person is important are direct connection with teachers, hands on learning experiences, and social interaction with peers. firstly, the direct connection between teachers and students fosters an environment in which teachers have the opportunity to see their students progression first hand. instructors can adjust their lessons accordingly and create a more tailored learning experience for students. in addition, the hands on learning experiences that are common in a physical classroom are lost in an online setting. students benefit most when they can interact with physical objects and resources as a way to engage with the course material. finally, attending school in person helps students to gain social interaction with their peers. being in the physical presence of other students provides a better opportunity to ask questions and seek clarification on a particular subject. connecting and bonding with other students helps to foster trust and understanding of the material being discussed. in conclusion, attending school in person has its advantages when it comes to student learning. establishing a direct connection with a teacher, having hands on learning experiences, and interacting with peers are all key benefits of physical attendance in the classroom. in order to maximize learning, the combination of online and in person classes should be considered.",0,0,2.137936842165817e-05
"the electoral college is outdated, unfair, and irrational and should be modified and updated so it is more fair to voters and the rest of the citizens. the founding fathers created it during the constitution as a compromise. this meaning it was made and designed for when it was needed. it did help the way presidents were voted for then,but its not suited for the population and other ways it has changed and is different in this time period. over 60 of voters would prefer a new and direct election rather than the system that we have now. under the electoral college we the people vote for electors, anyone not holding public office, who are chosen depending of the state by either state conventions, state party's central committee, or presidential candidates themselves. while voters are supposed to control who the electer votes for, sometimes they can make a mistake and vote for the wrong candidate. its not very often that mistakes like these happen, but they do occur. if a mistake like this was to happen the wrong candidate would be voted for that the people didn't choose, resulting in the possibility that a candidate we didnt vote for could and has the possibility if winning. something similar to this that happened back in 1960 was the biggest election crisis of the century. segregationists, who favored separation based on race, in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors who opposed john f. kennedy so the popular vote would not have been given to kennedy and he would noyhave won. in defense of the electoral college it was very helpful when it was needed at first, but now it's in the wrong time period. it exceeded obama's share of the popular vote when he received a 61.7 of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney in 2012. in conclusion the electoral college should beb changed so we have a new and improved way for the people to vote fairly for who they want.",1,1,0.9991376452515643
"legalization of marijuana a controversial debate marijuana legalization has been one of the most controversial topics in recent years. the debate on whether to legalize marijuana or not is a complex issue that needs to be addressed carefully. while some people argue that it should be legalized, others argue that it should not. i am in favor of the legalization of marijuana. in this essay, i will present my reasons and examples to support my position. first and foremost, the legalization of marijuana would generate revenue for the government. according to a report from the institute on taxation and economic policy, legalizing marijuana in the united states could generate 28 billion in tax revenue by 2025. this would help the government to fund various programs and services, such as education and healthcare. moreover, it would reduce the burden on law enforcement agencies, as they would no longer have to spend resources on arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana related offenses. secondly, marijuana has medicinal properties that can benefit people who suffer from various ailments. medical marijuana has been used to treat conditions such as chronic pain, epilepsy, and anxiety. by legalizing marijuana, more people would have access to this medication, and it would be easier for researchers to conduct studies on its potential benefits. lastly, legalization of marijuana would reduce the number of people incarcerated for marijuana related offenses. in the united states, approximately 40,000 people are incarcerated for marijuana related offenses. this is a staggering number, considering that marijuana is a relatively harmless drug compared to other substances such as alcohol and tobacco. legalizing marijuana would reduce the number of people incarcerated for drug related offenses and would also decrease the workload of the criminal justice system. in conclusion, the legalization of marijuana would generate revenue for the government, provide access to medical marijuana, and reduce the number of people incarcerated for marijuana related offenses. while some people argue that legalizing marijuana would have negative consequences, i believe that the benefits far outweigh the downsides. therefore, marijuana should be legalized.",0,0,9.487855113155426e-06

"technology has drastically changed the way humans interact with one another. on one hand, lt has enabled us to become more connected to people around the world, making longdlstance relationships possible and providing us with a wealth of information about the lives of others. on the other hand, lt has also created a form of disconnection between people, as we increasingly engage with a virtual world instead of the physical one. the effects of technology on human contact can be seen ln virtually every aspect of life. in the workplace, employees can now communicate more effectively and efficiently through small and other online tools. this has led to a increase ln productivity and ease of communication, making lt easier to stay ln touch with colleagues over long distances. on the other hand, the reliance on these technologies has taken a toll on our personal connections, as we often connect with our coworkers and acquaintances through screens instead of facetoface meetings. in the realm of social medley, technology has connected us to people ln unprecedented ways, allowing us to maintain contact with long lost friends and meet new people from all over the world. however, the sheer amount of information shared online has created a feeling of competition between users, leading to comparison and envy, which can be detrimental to our mental health. overall, technology has impacted the lives of people ln both positive and negative ways. while lt has enabled us to more easily stay connected, lt has also forced us to prioritize virtual conversations over physical ones. although technology has made communication more efficient and convenient, we must be mindful of lts potential to hinder our relationships and maintain balance ln our lives.",0,0,3.6428102265963532e-06

"i believe that every student should have the opportunity to participate in sports or activities at school, regardless of their academic performance. while it is important for students to maintain a certain grade level in order to participate, i believe that this should not be a strict requirement. instead, teachers should focus on identifying the unique strengths and weaknesses of each student and providing them with the support and resources they need to succeed. one of the main reasons why i believe this is that students who may not excel academically may still have hidden talents or skills that could be developed through sports or activities. for example, a student who struggles with math may have a natural talent for sports or music, and by giving them the opportunity to pursue these interests, they may be able to discover and develop these talents. additionally, students who may not have the resources or support at home to excel academically may benefit greatly from the structured environment of a school sports team or club. these activities can provide a sense of belonging and community, as well as the opportunity to learn valuable skills such as teamwork, leadership, and perseverance. furthermore, i believe that teachers should take a proactive abbroach to supporting students who may be struggling academically. instead of simply dismissing these students from participating in sports or activities, teachers should take the time to understand the root causes of their academic struggles and provide them with the support and resources they need to succeed. this could include onenote tutoring, extra held with homework, or even counseling to address any underlying issues. in conclusion, i believe that every student should have the opportunity to participate in sports or activities at school, regardless of their academic performance. by taking a proactive abbroach to supporting these students and identifying their unique strengths and weaknesses, we can held them develop into well rounded individuals who are equipped to succeed in all areas of their lives.",0,0,7.507856769796507e-06

"i think that summer projects should be student designed. this way, students can have the freedom to choose a topic that they are interested in and passionate about, which will make the learning process more enjoyable and meaningful for them. for example, if a student is interested in photography, they could design a project where they take pictures of different landmarks in their city and learn about the history behind them. this way, they will be learning about history, art, and photography all at once. on the other hand, if a teacher designs the project, it might not be as engaging for the student. the student might not have a say in the topic, and they might not be as motivated to complete the project. additionally, student designed projects allow students to develop important skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, and time management. they will have to come up with a plan, set goals, and figure out how to achieve them, which will help them become more independent learners. furthermore, student designed projects can also promote creativity and innovation. students can come up with unique and original ideas that might not have been thought of by a teacher. this will help them develop their problem solving skills and think outside the box. in conclusion, student designed summer projects are the way to go. they allow students to take ownership of their learning, develop important skills, and have fun while doing it.",0,0,0.00172303350423657
"does asking more than one person for a advice make it a better choice? i believe it does help but that can change depending on who you ask. let's say that you need help with a personal question, who are you going to ask your best friend or a stranger? probably your best friend because you can trust him and think his answer is better than your own. but lets say they are all trust worthy then is it better? yes it would be better to ask all of your friends to get the best answer. but you may value peoples answer more then others. like you will probably value you best friend more then someone you met 5 days ago. but would you trust someone who tells peoples secrets more then the person that never talks? you probably trust the guy who never speaks more because the guy tells peoples secret will just everyone what you asked. but if it is not personal then it would be fine to go and ask everybody and find the best choice you can do. in the end it is a good idea to ask everyone for advice as long as it is not personal. but if it is personal then get a group of trust worthy friend and ask them instead. like it would be better to ask a small group of good friends if it is personal like how to ask out a crush or what to get a crush a present. but it would be fine to ask anybody how to cook pancakes or how to teach a dog a trick.",1,1,0.9936174489911476
"limiting car usage might seem difficult for people, but it is an essential concept that needs to be addressed. cities across the globe have begun to realize the importance of promoting non car transportation, such as cycling, walking, and using public transit. this has not only reduced air pollution in major cities, but it's also improved people's lifestyle and mental stress. the day without cars event in colombian cities such as bogot , cali and valledupar has drawn the attention of other cities globally. it's an initiative that started years ago and has continued to gain momentum with the participation of millions of people. bogot , the capital city of colombia, has seen a significant change, and this event was only a part of it. since the mid 1990s, it's seen remarkable improvements in the city's infrastructure and has created a new lifestyle and a more relaxed cityscape. the 118 mile stretch dedicated to bicycles alone has made bogot the envy of other cities globally. it's an initiative that should encourage more people to take the same approach, promoting alternative transport, and creating less polluted and more accessible cities worldwide. in summary, the day without cars is an idea that's gaining traction across the globe. it encourages people to leave their cars and embrace other forms of transport in a bid to reduce pollution, promote a healthier lifestyle and reduce stress. this initiative has been adopted successfully in bogota and has created a new lifestyle for people that's not only more enjoyable but is also more accessible. the colombian capital has seen a significant reduction in the usage of private vehicles and has created more green and open spaces that are essential for mental wellbeing, promoting a more relaxed lifestyle. therefore limiting car usage can lead cities to be more accessible, less polluted and create an atmosphere that's more relaxed and enjoyable for everyone in the long run.",0,0,0.014496816403802988
"exploring venus a worthy pursuit despite the dangers? the planet venus, earth's closest cosmic neighbor, is a fascinating celestial body, yet its hostile environment presents a daunting challenge for exploration. however, in the challenge of exploring venus, the author argues that despite the risks, studying venus is a worthwhile endeavor. while the author provides some evidence to support this view, it remains a contentious issue. the author suggests that venus's geological similarities with earth and its proximity to our planet make it a valuable destination for planetary exploration. furthermore, the potential scientific gains are substantial, as understanding venus's evolution could provide crucial insights into planetary science, including earth's own future. these points are well argued and supported in the article. however, the author's argument falls short when considering the significant risks involved in exploring venus. the planet's extreme temperatures, atmospheric pressure, and dense carbon dioxide atmosphere present formidable obstacles that require substantial technological innovation to overcome. although the article discusses potential solutions like floating research stations, these ideas remain in their nascent stages, and their feasibility remains to be tested under real conditions. moreover, the author overlooks the potential dangers of studying venus. for example, venus's hostile environment could pose significant risks to astronaut health and safety. the article also fails to address the financial and ethical concerns associated with funding a potentially hazardous mission to venus. in conclusion, while the author makes a compelling case for studying venus, the risks involved in exploration cannot be ignored. the article's focus on potential scientific gains and technological possibilities is commendable, but it should have given more consideration to the ethical and financial concerns involved in pursuing such a mission. the author's argument is not entirely convincing, and it remains a challenging question whether studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.",0,0,8.329696895641926e-05

"dear teacher name, i don't agree with requiring all students to perform community service this is because i think that even those who don't do community service still care about our community. i think another main reason many students do not do community service is they do not have time. especially when you incorporate after school activities to your daily schedule. take me for example. i love my community and i enjoy helping it, i really just don't have the time. i have about 2 3 hours of homework a night. i have play rehearsal monday through thursday from 3 00 to 4 30. on mondays and fridays i have an hour long karate class. on tuesday, i babysit from 5 30 to 7 15. on thursdays i babysit from 4 30 until 7. finally on weekends i have lacrosse for an hour on sunday. this pretty much means my only day of rest is on saturday. i also know many of my friends are busy with religion, school, sports, as well as family. they as well do not have much free time. a suggestion for your idea might be not to make community service required, but a volunteer service. the student council may be able to make a sign up sheet with different acts of community service for each day of the week excluding the weekends. after these activities are developed by the student council, a sign up sheet should be available to kids in the main office if you sign up, you aren't expected to go every week. you should sign up each week for a day you are available. for example. if week one's list was on the wall, you wanted to participate and you knew you were busy every day of the week but tuesday, you would sign up for tuesday's community service act. you may want to go again week two, but only be available on thursday instead. this means you aren't expected to go to tuesday's community service again unless you signed up. kids may sign up as much or as little as they like. i'm sure that there will be a great turnout from volunteering kids. if you do not like my idea, i completely understand. i just don't like the idea of requiring all students to participate in community service. thank you, an eighth grader",1,1,0.9906253983293709
"students spend a significant amount of time in school and at home, regardless of their sleeping and leisure activities. while some may argue that more time in school can improve grades, i believe that students need more time to study, rest, and prepare for the next day. additionally, extending the school day can negatively impact students' extracurricular activities and personal lives, as well as teachers' personal and professional responsibilities. one of the main reasons why students need more time at home is to study and prepare for exams and assignments. students have a lot of work to do, and they need enough time to complete it effectively. xor example, a student who is a member of a local soccer or basketball team may have to spend several hours practicing and preparing for games or matches. if the school day is extended, the student may have less time to practice and prepare, which can negatively impact their performance on the team. this decision can also affect the teachers, who may have to adjust their schedules to accommodate the extended school day. moreover, students have other responsibilities outside of school, such as family obligations, appointments, and chores. if the school day is extended, students may have less time to attend to these responsibilities, which can create stress and anxiety. xor example, a teacher who has a child or children may have to pick them up from daycare or school if they don't use the bus. if the school day is extended, the teacher may have to adjust their schedule to accommodate the extended school day, which can be challenging. in conclusion, while some may argue that extending the school day can improve grades, i believe that students need more time to study, rest, and prepare for the next day. additionally, extending the school day can negatively impact students' extracurricular activities and personal lives, as well as teachers' personal and professional responsibilities. therefore, i disagree with the school board's plan to extend the school day and believe that they should focus on providing students with the resources and support they need to succeed academically and personally.",0,0,0.00022930479437045234

"the facial action coding system facs is an important tool used in the study of facial expressions and non verbal communication. developed by dr. paul ekman and his colleagues at the university of california, san francisco, the facs consists of 43 distinct facial movement units, or action units. these units help in identifying, describing, and understanding the various movements that occur in our faces when we communicate with each other. facs has been widely used in psychology, sociology, and anthropology to analyze facial expressions and non verbal communication in different cultures. the system is based on the premise that all human beings, regardless of their cultural background, exhibit similar facial expressions in response to emotions or situations. this allows for a universal language to describe these expressions, facilitating cross cultural communication and understanding. the facs system is organized into seven main categories 1. action units these units represent the basic movements of the face. they involve movements like raising the eyebrows, smiling, or narrowing the eyes. 2. action descriptors these are more complex facial movements, such as anger, disgust, fear, or sadness. these descriptors help in recognizing the emotions behind specific facial expressions. 3. facial expressions these are the combinations of action units and action descriptors that create specific facial expressions. for example, raising the eyebrows while smiling would create a surprised expression. 4. muscle movements these describe the movements of the muscles involved in producing the facial actions. this helps understand how the facial muscles work together to create the expressions. 5. muscle sources these describe the source of the muscle movements, such as the forehead or the cheek muscles. 6. facial grimaces these are unusual or extreme facial expressions that are often associated with pain, discomfort, or other unpleasant experiences. 7. facial gestures these are non verbal cues that accompany speech or other forms of communication. examples include nodding the head, shrugging the shoulders, or pointing the fingers. facs has revolutionized the study of facial expressions and non verbal communication, providing a comprehensive and standardized way of understanding and analyzing these complex phenomena. by breaking down facial expressions into basic action units, facs has helped in understanding how emotions and situations influence our facial movements, allowing researchers and psychologists to better interpret and analyze human behavior.",0,0,0.00010732625610044422

"the use of facial recognition technology like the facial action coding system in classrooms could provide both benefits and drawbacks then it comes to reading students' emotional expressions. on one hand, this technology may help teachers gain insights into hok their students are feeling during lessons. if a teacher notices many students appear confused or frustrated according to the technology, they could adjust their teaching methods to better explain difficult concepts. this could potentially improve learning outcomes. the technology could also assist teachers in identifying students who are feeling bored, sad, or disengaged, so they can check in on those students' wellbeing. however, there are also valid concerns about constantly monitoring students' emotions without their consent. students may feel uncomfortable knowing everything they subtly express face scan be analyzed and recorded. it could create an uncomfortably sterile environment that hinders creativity and natural human interactions. students may also feel pressured to mask their true emotions out of sorry the teacher could access records of then they appeared upset or distracted. overall, using facial recognition technology in classrooms could provide some academic and wellness benefits to teachers but may also negatively impact students' comfort levels and willingness to take risks in the learning process. there would need to be strict privacy policies in place and kay's for students to opt out of continuous scanning. more research on students' on perspectives would also be needed before widely adopting this type of technology without consent. in conclusion, while emotion tracking holds promise, more consideration of student experience is warranted before assuming it is inherently valuable in all classrooms.",0,0,0.0003080270157527757

"dear principal, i believe that students should not be required to perform community service. i feel that each student and their families have the right to not perform community service. but i do feel that one who performs community service should get some sort of reward. maybe extra credit points or a party would be sufficient. i think that students should have a choice of whether or not to perform community service, because i have experience with community service, and i find it rather boring and tiring. if they decide not to do it, they might not be well thought of, and that is their own problem. another reason for why i think that the students and their families should have a choice on performing community service is because they might not be able to. maybe a student's family does not own a car, and the work site is too far away to walk in a reasonable time. or, someone in the family has died, and one parent has to work seventy five hours a week, for a relatively low pay check. they also might be constantly busy, and just do not have the time for it. i would probably be more inclined in performing community service with incentives. this would probably give the students more motivation, thus, more community work would get completed. if they offered extra credit, a party, or maybe a homework pass, more students would work for their community. in the long term, they might get used to it, and feel that life is missing something, and would perform community service more often. the community service that the students perform, would also help students to grow closer to each other, and become mentally and sometimes physically stronger. it would also help the community. the students would be much more inclined to do it if some of the work that would need to be done directly benefited them, like a new park or skate park. this would not only help the community, but it would help the students too, whether the liked it or not, or even realized it, or not. the community would definitely realize it, and would feel much better about passing the world down to the next generation. sincerely, student name",1,1,0.9477894516185881
"in today's fast paced world, work has become an integral part of our lives. many people believe that work nowadays is more stressful and less leisurely than in the past. i completely agree with this statement, and in this essay, i will provide specific reasons and examples to support my opinion. firstly, the modern workplace is more competitive and demanding than ever before. with the rise of globalization and technological advancements, companies are under constant pressure to stay ahead of the competition. this has resulted in longer working hours, tighter deadlines, and increased workload for employees. for instance, a recent study conducted by the american psychological association found that more than 60 of employees reported feeling stressed at work due to excessive workload and unrealistic expectations. secondly, the nature of work has changed significantly over the years. in the past, most jobs were manual labor or involved repetitive tasks that did not require much mental effort. however, with the advent of automation and artificial intelligence, many jobs have become more complex and intellectually demanding. this has led to a higher level of stress and burnout among employees. for example, a software engineer working on a complex project may have to work long hours and deal with tight deadlines, which can be extremely stressful. finally, the work life balance has become increasingly difficult to maintain in today's world. with the rise of social media and the internet, people are expected to be available 24 7, which can be exhausting. moreover, many companies have adopted a culture of presenteeism, where employees are expected to be physically present in the office even if they have nothing to do. this can lead to a sense of guilt and anxiety among employees, who feel that they are not working hard enough. in conclusion, work nowadays is undoubtedly more stressful and less leisurely than in the past. the competitive nature of the modern workplace, the changing nature of work, and the difficulty in maintaining a work life balance are all contributing factors. it is essential for companies to recognize the importance of employee well being and take steps to reduce stress and promote a healthy work environment. only then can we hope to create a more sustainable and fulfilling work culture.",0,0,8.298846764380514e-06

"some schools allow online course to be taken by online video conference. i don't think that students should be allowed to work from home. here in why i do not think that students should work from home. first of all, the learning environment would be different at home than it in at school. by allowing students to learn from home they would be too busy playing on their phone or watching television rather than paying attention and actually learning. though some students may pay attention while they are at home, more students will not and focus on other thingy which will distract them from learning. another reason in that teaching are different when compared between online and at school. when students are at school, if they have a problem they can raise their hand to ask and the teacher will come and explain it. very at home, where a student will have to top the leyton of the entire clay to ask a question. even if the student aky the question online, the teacher may not understand what the student in asking and won't be able to yes the students work because it in online. finally, if students did not go to school and worked from home, many more kids would be socially awkward. if student work from home they would be able to make friend with those around them. they would not know how to their or to work a a team. because students go to school, they yes who people, their life, the religion, culture, and how they act around other. because they yes how other act they learn to adapt and to talk and work with other a if you worked from home you would talk to no one. in conclusion, i disagree that students should be allowed to work from home.",1,1,0.9972472490118871
"studies show there are many benefits to reducing time spent in high school. for students, the exertion of taking multiple classes can often be mentally and physically draining, making it difficult to stay motivated and engaged. reducing a student's course load in high school allows them more time to focus and invest in activities outside of the classroom that broaden their educational experiences. in the united states, there are multiple national programs that offer students the opportunity to reduce their time spent in high school. the department of education has implemented initiatives like the advanced placement test or the international baccalaureate program to allow students the chance to obtain high school credits at a faster pace. additionally, many states have implemented dual enrollment programs for high school students to take college classes with the potential for credit. the advantages of programs such as these are multifold. these initiatives provide students the opportunity to take classes in high school that they would otherwise not have the chance to experience. they also allow students the capacity to further develop their interest in particular subjects, by allowing them to have a more expansive learning experience. finally, programs such as these may reduce the cost of attending college by reducing the amount of course credits needed for graduation. in conclusion, there are many ways in which students can reduce their time spent in high school. through a variety of national programs, students have the opportunity to take classes that aid in their academic development and provide them with opportunities to explore different academic interests. ultimately, reducing time spent in high school can lead to personal growth, educational experiences, and economic benefits.",0,0,5.684424337536655e-05
"successful people are not afraid to try new things and take risks. they know that in order to achieve great things, they need to be willing to step outside their comfort zone. for example, when bill gates first started microsoft, he took a risk by betting his entire savings on the company. and it paid off microsoft became one of the most successful tech companies in the world. another example is elon musk. he is the founder of tesla, spacex, and several other startups. he is constantly trying new things and taking risks, even though many of his ventures have failed in the past. but he doesn t let that stop him he just keeps trying new things until he finds something that works. successful people know that if they want to achieve great things, they need to be willing to take risks. they know that there is no such thing as failure only learning experiences. and they are not afraid to try new things, even if they don t know how to do them yet. so if you want to be successful, don t be afraid to try new things and take risks. it may be scary at first, but it will be worth it in the end.",0,0,0.0016628576839781983
"to our principal, i fully support policy 1 on cell phone usage and completely against policy 2 . i believe that students have a right to bring along a cell phone and carry it on themselves as long as it is not a distraction or disturbance to the learning environment. they should be allowed to use them during instances allowing them. if they are seen with their cell phones out while a teacher is in the middle of an important lecture, unless he or she has gotten permission from the teacher it shall be confiscated immediately. when there are times allowing cell phones to be used, if a student is caught giving answers to a test or talking to someone in class, their phone should be taken up. pne thing that bothers me is students cheat using paper all the time but teachers only get upset when it is done over cell phone. i think it's the same information, just being transferred a different way. there is no telling what students say to each other, using notes or cell phones. it could easily be on both. if a student's phone is taken up for them talking to someone, why do teachers not take up paper notes being passed? they are doing the same action, only on a different device. i also believe that cell phones are a good way to contact someone outside of school. let's use someone left their lunch at home for example. it would be easier to let your teacher know and to have them allow contacting their parent via cell phone in class than to have to get permission to go down to the front office, ask permission to use the phone, and then call. also, some people use their electronic contact book and don't memorize numbers. the school may have your house number on file, but they don't have your parent's work number or cell phone number. it would be better to contact them using a number they can recognize. some people don't answer to numbers they don't know, even except caller id.",1,1,0.9926764714897429
"the electoral college is a unique aspect of the american political system that serves as the means for electing the president and vice president of the united states. the system has its advantages and disadvantages, and it can be argued that the electoral college either works effectively or not. one of the benefits of the electoral college is that it ensures representation from various states across the country. this is because each state is given a specific number of electoral votes, which are based on its population. as a result, candidates must campaign in all states, not just those with large cities or dense populations, in order to win the presidency. this promotes a sense of national unity and helps to prevent candidates from only focusing on urban areas. another advantage is that it provides an extra layer of protection against tyranny. in the event that the majority of the population votes against the candidate with the most electoral college votes, the electors have the power to decide which candidate to elect. this safeguards against the possibility of a candidate winning the majority vote but still being unpopular among the general public. on the downside, the electoral college can result in the candidate who receives the most popular votes losing the election. this has happened multiple times in u.s. history, including in the 2000 and 2016 presidential elections. critics argue that this is an inherent flaw in the system, as it goes against the principle of majority rule. moreover, the electoral college can lead to strategic voting and gerrymandering. in some states, electoral votes are awarded based on the winner of the popular vote. however, in other states, the winner takes all the electoral votes, regardless of the percentage of the vote they receive. this can encourage voters to focus their efforts on certain swing states instead of campaigning nationwide, leading to potential manipulation of the electoral process. in conclusion, while the electoral college has its merits, such as ensuring representation for all states and acting as a safeguard against tyranny, it also has significant drawbacks. the system can result in a disconnect between the popular vote and the election outcome, as well as promote strategic voting and potential gerrymandering. as the electoral college has existed for over two centuries and continues to shape the political landscape in america, it is essential to evaluate its effectiveness and potential improvements.",0,0,0.008724287837126737

"while the idea of the face on mars being created by aliens is intriguing, the evidence clearly shows that it is simply a natural landform formed by erosion over millions of years. there are several reasons why the face was not artificially constructed. for one, the scale of the structure does not match what would be expected for an intentional monument. at just over 1 kilometer wide, it is far too small to reasonably serve as some kind of message or marker left by an advanced extraterrestrial civilization capable of interplanetary travel. the scale is much more consistent with the size of geological formations shaped by natural forces like wind and water erosion. additionally, when viewed from other angles besides the famous front facing view, it becomes apparent that the face lacks any well defined symmetrical features. instead, it resembles an oddly eroded mesa or butte that only takes on a superficial facelike shape from one vantage point. if it were truly an artificial construction, it likely would maintain clearer facial features from multiple angles. most conclusively, the material the face is composed of has been scientifically analyzed and shown to be typical sedimentary deposits common throughout mars, without any anomalous chemical signatures. there is no evidence it contains any construction materials not found elsewhere on the planet's surface. xver millions of years, natural geological processes like rivers carving through layered sediments could easily form an irregular shape that under the right lighting resembles a human face. in conclusion, while the coincidental facial appearance captured in an iconic nasa photo was intriguing and sparked speculation, thorough scientific analysis reveals the face on mars is without a doubt a simple geological landform, not evidence of an alien civilization. the scale, lack of defined features from other angles, and composed of typical martian sediments all definitively prove it is a product of natural martian geology, not artificial construction by extraterrestrials. the most reasonable conclusion, based on available evidence, is that it was slowly weathered into its present form over the martian planetary history.",0,0,0.028584810132555673
"in the digital era, where everything seems to be available online, the question of whether libraries are still relevant or not has become increasingly common. however, i firmly believe that despite the prevalence of digital resources, libraries continue to hold immense importance in our society. this essay will argue for the continued importance of libraries by highlighting their unique roles in promoting education, fostering community engagement, and ensuring equitable access to information. firstly, libraries play a pivotal role in promoting education at all levels. they provide students with access to a vast array of books, academic journals, and other learning materials that may not be readily available elsewhere. moreover, libraries offer a conducive environment for studying and research, which is essential for academic success. in addition to traditional educational resources, libraries also house digital resources such as e books, online databases, and educational software, further enhancing their value in the digital age. thus, by serving as hubs of knowledge, libraries significantly contribute to lifelong learning and personal growth. secondly, libraries act as community centers, fostering social interaction and engagement among diverse groups of people. libraries often host events such as book clubs, author talks, workshops, and educational programs, creating opportunities for individuals to come together, share ideas, and build connections. furthermore, libraries provide access to technology, bridging the digital divide and ensuring that everyone can participate in the increasingly digital world. by serving as community spaces, libraries promote social cohesion and inclusivity, making them invaluable institutions within our society. lastly, libraries ensure equitable access to information, which is crucial in an age where misinformation and fake news abound. libraries provide reliable, trustworthy sources of information, thereby combating the spread of falsehoods and ensuring that people can make informed decisions. additionally, libraries offer free access to resources, removing financial barriers that might otherwise prevent individuals from accessing essential information. thus, libraries play a crucial role in upholding the principles of democracy by ensuring equal access to information for all. in conclusion, while the digital age has undoubtedly transformed how we access information, libraries continue to hold immense value in our society. by promoting education, fostering community engagement, and ensuring equitable access to information, libraries serve as vital institutions that contribute to personal growth, social cohesion, and the democratic process. therefore, we must continue to support and invest in our libraries, recognizing their unique roles in shaping our communities and our futures.",0,0,2.750981325740008e-10
"i think the electoral college need changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united state . because under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. if you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry. on the off chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 electoral votes. the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. the american people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiaso was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse. consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from california, who represent 35 million voters. given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the house's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. the electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in state they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing state. during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including rhode island and south carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. if anyoune has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in hands of a few swing voters in ohio, they have yet to make it. the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.",1,1,0.9958486432513396
"dear principal, have you ever had to clean up other peoples trash off the side of the street, clean up dog poop from someone else's lawn, or had to walk across the beach and pick up cans, paper, bottles, and any other garbage that has been left at the beach. if you have good for you but not all people need or want to help the community. i think that we should leave community service up to the volunteers and people who got sent to community service by law. instead of having everybody do it at the school. you could have everybody that gets in trouble do it as a punishment. why would you have everybody do it when you could have people that want to do it do it so there is no complaining. i think that if there is complaining there will be fighting and that will just cause trouble. not everyone wants to do community service so only have the people that want to do it help the community or else everyone else is going to complain and not follow the rules so there would be more people getting in trouble. when more people get in trouble the schools rating will go down and less people will go to that school so do you really want that? i'm guessing not especially if your the principal. so only have the people that want to do it do it so there are less fights and the school rating doesn't go down. sincerely student name",1,1,0.9999776364381042
"what is the point of driving a car now and days anyways? in vauban, germany even soccer moms gave up their car. paris even bans car driving due the smog. in bogota, colombia has a program that they wants to go worldwide. let talk about vauban, germany you can't park on the street, in your own driveway nor your home garages are forbidden. vanban is completely car free . at first i really thought that was a joke but its not. downtown they are allowed to have car ownership. what sense does that make. if the car owner buys a space for 40,000, and plus the new home. 70 precent of vauban familes do not own cars. but 57 percent sold their car to move to vauban. vanban completed in 2006. 5,500 residents in vauban. think about it most people in vauban dont have cars. now lets get on to paris... paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. on monday's motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars home or pay a fine of 31 dollars, same thing goes for the odd numbered plates. almost 4,000 drivers were fined. 27 people had their car inpounded for the reaction to how much the fine was. car traffic was down too 60 . 5 days after intensifying the smog. diesel fuel was blammed. diesel makes 67 of vehicles in france.",1,1,0.9996256138056303
"kave you ever wondered what people think about you or what impressions they have about you? it's a difficult question to answer, but i believe that everyone does it. first impressions are not always positive for ourselves, and they can make us doubt about ourselves, seek people's approval, and have a low esteem. first impressions are not always positive and can come into our lives with bad intentions. as the first point, first impressions make us overthink what to say and do, making us doubt ourselves and lose our confidence. we should not worry about what others think about us because each person has their own life and their own problems. in high schools, most students seek the approval of their friends, especially teenagers. essentially, these teenagers do not have their own life. in fact, first impressions affect all people, but mostly teenagers. they get a low esteem, all because of the system in which we live, first impressions. i remember my first year of high school, i was afraid to like a little chicken with no idea what to do or what to say, wondering what they were thinking about me. there were a few days that i didn't want to go to school because i felt that the other students had bad impressions about me. in conclusion, first impressions can make us doubt ourselves, seek people's approval, and have a low esteem. we should not worry about what others think about us because each person has their own life and their own problems. first impressions affect all people, but mostly teenagers. we should focus on developing our own life and not worry about what others think about us.",0,0,0.4499025405892615
"i strongly agree that we have become a throw away society. the idea of disposing of what we no longer need has become an ingrained part of our lives, and we no longer consider the consequences of our actions on our environment. the most visible example of this is plastic bags. plastic bags are used all over the world to carry groceries and other items, and are often thrown away when they are no longer needed. unfortunately, plastic bags take hundreds of years to decompose, and they often end up in landfills or floating in oceans and rivers. in addition, when plastic bags are burned, they release toxic chemicals into the air, which can have damaging effects on human health. another example of our throw away society is electronic waste, or e waste. when electronic devices reach the end of their life cycle, they are often disposed of in landfills, where they can release toxic chemicals into the environment. even if these devices are recycled, it is often done in developing countries, where workers are exposed to dangerous chemicals in the process. finally, our throw away society has led to an increase in food waste. in many parts of the world, food is thrown away without any thought given to the people who are in need. according to the united nations food and agriculture organization, a third of all food produced worldwide is wasted, and this leads to increased levels of methane gas in the atmosphere, which is a major contributor to climate change. in conclusion, our throw away society has had a devastating impact on our environment. if we want to protect our planet from further damage, we need to change our habits and start being more mindful of our actions. we need to reduce our reliance on disposable items and think about the consequences of our actions on the environment. only then will we be able to create a sustainable future for generations to come.",0,0,0.010568849037219552
"while the facial action coding system technology described in the article has the potential to provide insights into students' emotional states, its use to read students' facial expressions in the classroom raises some concerns. on one hand, this technology could help teachers understand how their lessons are being received on an individual level. by detecting emotions like confusion, frustration or boredom in real time, teachers may be able to adjust their instruction or better identify students who need additional support. this could help optimize students' learning experiences. however, there are also significant privacy and implementation challenges. continuous emotion tracking of students without their consent could undermine trust in teacher student relationships. it may also lead to overanalysis of minor emotional fluctuations that do not truly reflect how students are processing information. teachers would need extensive training to properly interpret the data and avoid making assumptions. furthermore, facial expressions do not always correlate directly with internal emotional experiences. students' expressions could be influenced by many contextual factors unrelated to the lesson, like their interactions earlier that day. relying too heavily on this technology to gauge academic engagement or achievement could thus provide an incomplete or misleading picture. in the end, the use of this technology in classrooms is premature without more research on its accuracy and impact on students. teachers are still best placed to understand their students through ongoing dialogue and observation over time. while emotion tracking technology may have a role to play eventually, its current capabilities are too limited to replace traditional methods of assessing student comprehension and experience in the classroom. more study is needed before widespread classroom adoption. in conclusion, while the facial action coding system aims to provide useful insights, its current use to continuously monitor students' emotional expressions raises privacy, implementation and reliability challenges that outweigh its potential benefits. traditional ways of evaluating students seem more appropriate until this technology is proven to enhance, not replace, teacher judgement.",0,0,2.1174088304687355e-05

"using cars today is polluting the air we breath in everyday, worse and wrose. having a world free of cars would not only help with air pollution, but with everyone's saftey as well. in german suburds 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move in the german suburb. they would sell thier car s , and live without a car, and live a less stressful life. when i had a car i was always tense. i'm much happier this way said heidrun walter, a mother of two. i'm sure heidrun wasn't the only one who felt like that. having no car wouldd take more stress of your life then you think. you wouldn't have to pay a car payment every month. you wouldn't have to worry about hvaing to pay for gas to get around. lastly you wouldn't have to worry about getting into a car accident every time you got behind the wheel of a car. all of our development since world war ll has been centered on the car, and that will have to change said david goldberg. goldberg is right. we put most of our attention and development into cars, and focus more on them than we really should. we don't really realize what damage cars are causing us yet, and probably won't realize for a long time from now. aftrer days of near record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. on monday motorist with even numbered license plates were orded to leave thier cars at home or suffer a 31 fine. the same would apply to odd number plates the following day. they should not only be doing this in paris but everywhere to reduce the air pollution. the fine should be higher also to those who don't follow the rules. unless you havea real emergency to use your car the day you are not suppose to then don't use it. not using cars would be a huge problem solver to most of us. it will help with air pollution. it will help with finacial problems by not having to worry about car payments or money for gas. lastly it will help wiith the stress in people's lives and lower it.",1,1,0.9857508333328229
"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular photo. the electoral college is an outdated and undemocratic system that gives more power to some states than others. it is also a system that can be easily manipulated, as we saw in the 2000 election. in 2000, al gore won the popular photo by over 500,000 notes, but he lost the election because he won fewer electoral notes than george w. bush. this was because bush won several key states by a very narrow margin, while gore won many states by a large margin. this system is unfair to voters in states that are not considered swing states. voters in these states know that their notes will not matter, because their state will always photo for the same party. this means that they have no incentive to photo, and their forces are not heard. the electoral college also discourages candidates from campaigning in all parts of the country. they know that they only need to win a few swing states to win the election, so they focus all of their attention on those states. this means that voters in other states are ignored, and their concerns are not taken into account. the electoral college is a system that is ripe for abuse. in 2016, donald trump won the electoral college even though he lost the popular photo by over 3 million notes. this was because he won several key states by a very narrow margin, while hillary clinton won many states by a large margin. it is possible for a candidate to win the electoral college without winning the popular photo, and this is a dangerous precedent. it means that the president of the united states could be elected by a minority of voters. in conclusion, i belief that the electoral college is an outdated and undemocratic system that should be abolished. i urge you to support a constitutional amendment that would elect the president of the united states by popular photo. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.009828835524364867
"ralph waldo emerson famously stated, to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. the idea of individualism has been embedded in our society since the dawn of time. in today's fast paced world, it is often easy to get lost in the collection of society's norms and expectations. however, having the freedom to think and act without the fear of judgment can be beneficial both in and out of the workplace. individuals have the power to create their own unique style of work that will lead to success. this allows them to take control of their lives and figure out how to reach their goals in the best way possible. meanwhile, selflessness involves serving and helping others it has different implications from expressing one's individuality. the former requires the individual to put others first, while the latter is all about taking the initiative to live life according to one's own beliefs and values. in the future, we could expect to see individualism being used as a form of resistance and as a tool for self expression. as the world continues to become more diverse and inclusive, individuals who practice individualism will be better equipped and empowered to challenge the status quo. this could open up new realms of opportunities for people that were previously out of reach. individuality may be the key to unlocking a bright and successful future.",0,0,9.340645421817331e-05

"the face on mars, a mesa in cydonia, has been a subject of fascination for decades. when nasa's viking 1 spacecraft first captured an image of it 25 years ago, it sparked a lot of interest as it appeared to resemble a face. this led to many conspiracy theories and fueled the belief that there could be life on mars. however, after nasa's mars global surveyor took more images of cydonia, it was revealed that the face on mars was just a natural landform, much like mesas or buttes on earth. claims there are several reasons why the face on mars is not evidence of extraterrestrial life. first, the formation of mesas on earth is a result of natural geological processes, and the same can be said for the face on mars. second, laser altimetry has confirmed that the face on mars is a natural formation. lastly, the location of cydonia, where the face is located, is of geological interest as it is at a potential ancient martian ocean boundary, which raises questions about mars' past. evidence according to the article, the mars global surveyor's images of cydonia show that the face on mars is just a natural landform. the laser altimetry data also supports this conclusion, as it confirms that the formation of mesas on earth is similar to the formation of mesas on mars. the geological interest in cydonia is also evidence that the face on mars is not evidence of alien life as it suggests that the formation of mesas on mars is a result of natural geological processes. conclusion in conclusion, the face on mars is just a natural landform, and it is not evidence of alien life. the evidence from nasa's mars global surveyor and the laser altimetry data confirm that the formation of mesas on mars is similar to the formation of mesas on earth, which are the result of natural geological processes. the geological interest in cydonia also supports this conclusion, as it suggests that the formation of mesas on mars is a result of natural geological processes. therefore, we should not jump to conclusions based on a single image, and we should always rely on scientific evidence to make informed conclusions.",0,0,0.021381126502282966

"the debate over the electoral college, a system where voters select electors who then elect the president, has been raging for many years. while opponents argue that it's an outdated and unfair system, proponents cite reasons such as protection of state interests and federalism that have made it an integral part of us elections. proposals to get rid of the electoral college argue that there's an urgent need for change to make us presidential elections fairer by ensuring that the winner of the vote gets elected. one of the key points raised by supporters is that it eliminates confusion that can result from the use of complex voting systems like the electoral college, which has the potential to produce a result that may not reflect the popular sentiment. critics of the electoral college have also raised the issue of faithless electors, arguing these can throw elections off balance, and lead to disastrous results like the one that happened during the 2000 presidential elections. they have also argued that direct elections, as is the norm in many other countries, may be the simplest and most equitable system that would reflect the will of the electorate accurately. despite the criticism of the electoral college, there are still valid reasons for keeping it. proponents argue that it helps protect regional interests of smaller states and ensures that presidential candidates don't just concentrate solely on populous areas. additionally, the electoral college's origins have ties to concessions given to slaveholders in the southern states that needed protection against larger populations. in conclusion, i argue that the united states should stick to the electoral college system, as it has been a tried and true method of election over the years. the benefits that come from the system's origins have made it an integral part of us elections and should not be taken for granted. however, there are ways to improve the electoral college system, including reducing the chances of faithless electors, that we must explore. therefore, i urge you as my representative to vote against getting rid of the electoral college. sincerely, your name",0,0,7.254592553432426e-05

"introduction driverless cars are a hot topic of discussion nowadays. some people think they are a great invention, while others believe they are dangerous. in the article driverless cars are coming, the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. after reading the article, i believe that driverless cars are a bad idea. body one of the main reasons why i am against driverless cars is that they could cause accidents. the article states that driverless cars rely on sensors and software to navigate the roads, but these systems can fail. if the sensors and software fail, the car could crash, and people could get hurt. additionally, driverless cars might not be able to handle unexpected situations, such as a pedestrian suddenly crossing the road. another reason why i am against driverless cars is that they could lead to job loss. the article mentions that many people make a living by driving, such as taxi and truck drivers. if driverless cars become widespread, these people could lose their jobs, which would be devastating for them and their families. finally, i believe that driverless cars are unnecessary. the article states that some experts argue that driverless cars could reduce traffic accidents and make roads safer. however, i think that we can achieve these goals without driverless cars. for example, we could improve public transportation, which would reduce the number of cars on the road and make driving safer. conclusion in conclusion, i am against the development of driverless cars. they could cause accidents, lead to job loss, and are unnecessary. while some people might think that driverless cars are a great invention, i believe that we should focus on improving public transportation instead.",0,0,0.03994478473532991
"the facial action coding system facs is a way to analyze and classify facial expressions. developed by dr. paul ekman and dr. wallace friesen, it provides a standardized method for studying and identifying the movements and muscle actions involved in various human emotions. facs breaks down facial expressions into a comprehensive set of action units aus . aus are distinct components that, when combined, form the overall expression. each au represents a specific muscle action or movement, such as raising the eyebrows, wrinkling the nose, or compressing the lips. by analyzing these aus, scientists can better understand the complexities of human emotions, as well as the universal nature of certain facial expressions. this system has been extensively researched and applied in various fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and computer science. one of the most significant applications of facs is the development of emotion recognition technology. by analyzing facial expressions using aus, researchers can create algorithms that can accurately identify and categorize emotions in real time. this technology is already being utilized in various industries, such as advertising, entertainment, and healthcare, to improve the overall user experience and understanding of human emotions. in summary, the facs is a valuable tool for studying and classifying facial expressions. it allows researchers to deconstruct complex emotions into simple aus, providing a comprehensive understanding of human emotions and their universal nature. additionally, this system has led to the development of emotion recognition technology with various real life applications.",0,0,2.0372057690457235e-06
"making mona lisa smile, an article published in the journal of advanced science, presents a groundbreaking technology that promises to revolutionize the field of education. the facial action coding system facs , developed by professor thomas huang, is a software that can interpret even the subtlest of facial expressions to identify a range of emotions. this technology has immense implications for the classroom, as it offers a real time emotional map of the classroom and empowers teachers to tailor their approach to individual student needs. one of the most impressive aspects of huang's software is its ability to differentiate between similar emotions such as confusion and boredom or interest and indifference, thus offering educators a tool not just for understanding but also for engagement and intervention. the software's ability to construct a 3 d model of the face mimicking human facial expressions with astonishing precision means that it can adapt lessons in real time, just like an effective human instructor. this level of customization means that teachers can focus their attention where it is most needed, while the software ensures that each student's learning journey is as individual as they are. the facial action coding system also fosters a sense of community and mutual understanding among students. recognizing that facial expressions are universal, the system helps students see that they are not alone in their emotional responses. this shared understanding can foster collaboration and empathy, breaking down barriers of isolation and misunderstanding. however, some skeptics question the efficacy of a computerized system in understanding complex human emotions and the nuances of face to face learning. despite these concerns, dr. huang argues that much of human communication is nonverbal, and the facial action coding system is designed to recognize and respond to these nonverbal cues, rather than replacing human interaction. in conclusion, the facial action coding system has the potential to revolutionize the way we teach and learn. it offers educators a powerful tool for understanding and engaging with students on a deeper level, while also fostering a sense of community and empathy in the classroom. while there may be some concerns about the efficacy of a computerized system in understanding complex emotions, the facial action coding system is a significant advancement in the field of education, and it is exciting to think about the possibilities it presents for the future.",0,0,0.0001720412196173
"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular vote. i believe that this is the best way to ensure that the president is elected by the people, and that all votes are counted equally. the electoral college is an outdated system that is no longer relevant in our modern society. it was created in a time when the united states was a much smaller country, and travel was much more difficult. in those days, it was not feasible for voters to cast their ballots directly for president. instead, they would vote for electors, who would then meet in their state capitals and cast their votes for president. today, however, travel is much easier, and voters can easily cast their ballots directly for president. there is no longer any need for the electoral college. in fact, the electoral college actually disenfranchises millions of voters. in 2016, for example, hillary clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, but she lost the election to donald trump because she did not win enough electoral votes. this is a problem because it means that the president is not elected by the majority of the people. instead, the president is elected by a few swing states. this is unfair to voters in states that are not considered to be swing states. their votes are essentially meaningless, because the candidates know that they cannot win those states and so they do not campaign there. abolishing the electoral college would ensure that all votes are counted equally. every voter in the united states would have a voice in choosing the president. this would be a more just and fair system, and it would be more representative of the will of the people. i urge you to support abolishing the electoral college and electing the president by popular vote. this is the best way to ensure that the president is elected by the people, and that all votes are counted equally. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.0035423863906849915
"seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because considering different perspectives allows for more informed decision making. getting advice from more than one person provides a broader range of viewpoints and expertise on any given issue. each person may have a unique insight or piece of wisdom to share tased on their own background and experiences. by hearing multiple sides of a story or multiple potential options, a person asking for advice has more information to weigh the pros and cons of each choice. they can compare and synthesize the different opinions to gain a more holistic understanding of their situation and decision. an example of how seeking various opinions helped lead to a better outcome occurred when a friend of mine was deciding whether to accept a new jot offer or stay in their current role. they consulted with not only their parents and spouse, tut also their manager, coworkers, and friends who had recently changed jots themselves. this allowed them to get input from those who knew their abilities and work history as well as those familiar with the different companies and responsibilities of each position. incorporating perspectives from both their personal and professional networks helped them carefully consider factors like growth opportunities, work life balance, and company stability that any single person may not have brought up. after weighing all the advice, my friend felt confident that they had made the choice that was test for their long term career goals and needs. in summary, getting multiple opinions provides a decision maker with well rounded guidance ty exposing them to new ideas and mitigating individual biases. it enables a more informed final choice that takes numerous relevant viewpoints into account rather than relying on the perspective of just one or two advisors. while a single person's advice can certainly help, the complexity of most significant decisions warrants seeking opinions from various trusted sources.",0,0,0.0068269022949405305

"as an eighth grade student, i believe that extending the school day by two hours could have both positive and negative effects on students' ability to learn and succeed. on one hand, it could provide more time for students to complete their work and improve their grades. on the other hand, it could lead to cognitive impairment and reduced availability of after school activities. firstly, extending the school day could provide more time for students to complete their work and improve their grades. this could be particularly beneficial for students who struggle with time management or who have a lot of homework assignments. by having more time to work on their assignments, students could reduce their stress levels and improve their grades. additionally, teachers could use the extra time to provide additional support and guidance to students who need it. however, there are also potential risks associated with extending the school day. one of the biggest risks is cognitive impairment. studies have shown that students who attend school for longer periods of time are more likely to experience cognitive impairment, which can negatively impact their ability to learn and succeed. this could be particularly problematic for students who already struggle with attention and focus. another potential risk is reduced availability of after school activities. many students participate in extracurricular activities after school, such as sports, music, and clubs. if the school day is extended, it could limit the time available for these activities. this could be particularly problematic for students who rely on these activities to develop their social skills and interests. finally, having a four day workweek could also impact students' ability to learn and succeed. while some students may prefer a four day workweek, others may struggle to manage their time effectively. additionally, teachers may struggle to provide adequate support and guidance to students who are not in the classroom for as much time. in conclusion, while extending the school day by two hours could provide more time for students to complete their work and improve their grades, it could also lead to cognitive impairment and reduced availability of after school activities. additionally, having a four day workweek could also impact students' ability to learn and succeed. ultimately, whether the current school day should be changed depends on a variety of factors, including the needs and preferences of students and teachers, as well as the potential risks and benefits of different options.",0,0,4.117756109200861e-06
"while distance learning offers some benefits, i believe that attending classes in person is generally more conducive to student success. some of the advantages often cited for distance learning options are increased flexibility and the ability to learn from home, which can help students balance school with family, work or health issues. however, learning remotely comes with several drawbacks. one challenge is the lack of direct interaction between students and teachers. in a physical classroom, students have many opportunities every day to ask questions, get clarification and receive feedback. this back and forth discussion is important for comprehension and problem solving. it can be more difficult to have these kinds of discussions in an online setting. students learning at home may feel isolated from their peers as well. part of the education experience is collaborating with and learning from other students. additionally, it can be challenging for students to stay motivated and maintain focus while learning independently from home. the structure and accountability of in person classes helps keep students on track. it may be easier for students to get distracted or fall behind while learning remotely. being physically present in the classroom also discourages behaviors like plagiarism or cheating. finally, not all students have an environment at home that is conducive to focused study and attention. distractions from family, chores, pets or technology can impair learning from home. while distance options provide value for some situations, attending classes in the structured setting of a physical school is generally more practical and effective for most students. the socialization and accountability benefits of face to face classes better support learning objectives for high school students. therefore, i believe students are best served by attending classes in person rather than choosing distance learning options on a regular basis. exceptions could be made on a case by case basis for students with extenuating medical or family circumstances.",0,0,8.524195992147521e-05

"choosing a career at a young age can be a daunting task, but it is also an important one. as an eighth grade student, i believe that it is essential to have the knowledge and guidance of teachers and counselors in order to make an informed decision about my future. one of the main benefits of choosing a career at a young age is that it allows individuals to focus their education and resources towards their desired field. by the time they finish high school, students will have a clear idea of what they want to pursue and can work towards obtaining the necessary skills and knowledge to achieve their goals. this can save time and money, as well as increase the likelihood of success in the long run. teachers and counselors play a crucial role in guiding students towards their desired careers. they can provide valuable information about different fields of study, help students identify their strengths and interests, and offer advice on how to prepare for a particular career. additionally, teachers and counselors can help students connect with internships and other opportunities that can give them hands on experience and help them make informed decisions about their future. it is also important to note that choosing a career at a young age does not mean that individuals are locked into that decision for the rest of their lives. many people change careers multiple times throughout their lives, and it is important to be open to new opportunities and experiences. however, by having a strong foundation in a particular field and the knowledge to make informed decisions, individuals will be better equipped to navigate these changes and find success in their chosen career. in conclusion, choosing a career at a young age has many benefits, including the ability to focus education and resources, gain valuable experience, and make informed decisions. teachers and counselors play a crucial role in guiding students towards their desired careers, providing valuable information and support. as an eighth grade student, i believe that it is essential to take advantage of the resources available to me in order to make an informed decision about my future.",0,0,2.9116443790396834e-06
"the challenge of exploring venus, is an article written by someone who is arguing that venus is a worthy exploration, despite the fact that it is highly dangerous. the author's claim was strong, and the points were valid. they included many supported statements, and facts, and arguments that support their case very well. throughout the article, the author gives many statements that help support their statement that venus is worth the risk. in paragraph 2, the author discusses all the qualities and characteristics that make venus an ideal planet to study. venus is most similar to earth by means of size and density, and at times, the closest in distance. in paragraph 4, further evidence is put forth. paragraph 4 discusses the interest scientists have in exploring venus. it states, astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system. scientists believe venus might have once been covered in oceans, which could have easily supported some sort of life. the author included that evidence to show readers that venus might hold questions many scientists want answers to. the author wants the reader to think more into the exploration of venus and all the positive outcomes it could bring us. the author supported their statements and claims adequately. for each point the author made, they gave factual evidence that backed up their point. each statement was legitimate. for instance, one of the author's points was made in paragraph 5. the author uses an idea from nasa to back up their claim. it states, nasa's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. nasa is working on ways to put explorers on venus, and the author uses that to help further his claim that venus should be explored, dangerous or not. the author gives so many points and outside evidence that their claim is more than supported.",1,1,0.978971118576705
"title exploring venus venus, the second planet from the sun, has always fascinated humans with its mysterious atmosphere and unique geological features. over time, numerous missions have been sent to unravel the secrets of this celestial body. in the following paragraphs, i will discuss some of the key findings from these missions, as well as future possibilities for exploring venus. 1. the magellan mission launched in 1989, magellan was a nasa orbital radar mission that spent four years mapping venus in unprecedented detail. the mission revealed a diverse landscape, featuring mountains, volcanic plains, and canyons. the most significant discovery from magellan was that the planet is covered in numerous volcanoes, some of which are still active. 2. venera missions the soviet union sent a series of spacecraft called venera between 1961 and 1984. the primary goal of these missions was to study the atmosphere and surface of venus. venera 13, which landed on venus in 1982, found the surface to be extremely hot and covered in fine, volcanic ash. 3. akatsuki mission launched by jaxa japan aerospace exploration agency in 2010, akatsuki was intended to study the atmosphere of venus. however, due to a technical glitch in its orbit, the spacecraft ended up in a highly elliptical orbit around venus. in 2015, akatsuki successfully entered its planned orbit, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit venus since the soviet vega 1 and vega 2 missions in the 1980s. 4. future exploration as our technology and understanding of venus improve, there are several potential future missions that could help us explore this enigmatic planet in more detail. some ideas include sending a balloon probe to float within the thick atmosphere, drone like probes that can survive the extreme conditions on the surface, or even human colonies. in conclusion, venus has been an intriguing target for space exploration due to its unique features, such as its dense atmosphere and numerous volcanoes. the missions discussed have contributed significantly to our understanding of the planet. as technology advances, there are numerous opportunities for future exploration that may help unravel the mysteries of venus and provide valuable insights into our own planet's history and evolution.",0,0,0.0022134235738592136
"dear senator, i am writing to express my view that the united states should change from the electoral college system to electing the president by popular vote. while the electoral college was designed to give smaller states more influence, i believe the popular vote method is more democratic and aligns better with the values of our nation. one argument made in favor of keeping the electoral college is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign in more states. however, research shows that presidential candidates tend to focus their attention only on swing states that could vote either way. this leaves voters in many non competitive states feeling ignored. a popular vote system would motivate candidates to appeal to a broader range of americans across all 50 states. it is also argued that the electoral college preserves the federal character of our elections. but in practice, the winner take all allocation of electoral votes in most states means that the national popular vote winner can still lose the electoral college. this has led to controversial outcomes where the president was not the choice of a majority of voters nationwide. a direct popular election would make sure the president always has the support of more citizens. a counterargument is that smaller states may lose influence without the electoral college. however, each citizen's vote would still count equally in a national popular vote regardless of what state they live in. candidates would still have an incentive to build geographically diverse coalitions rather than just focusing on dense population centers. a popular vote may also increase voter turnout nationally as more people's votes directly impact the outcome. in conclusion, while reasonable arguments can be made on both sides of this issue, i believe a national popular vote is a fairer system that aligns better with democratic principles of equality and majority rule. it would encourage greater political participation. for these reasons, i think we should implement a popular vote for electing the president. thank you for considering my views on this important issue.",0,0,0.007384013107761103

"the history of mathematics is filled with interesting developments and discoveries. while the ancient greeks and romans made important contributions to the field, it was not until the middle ages that mathematical knowledge advanced significantly. this period saw great advancements in algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and arithmetic. mathematics has since been applied to diverse fields such as astronomy, engineering, economics and finance. in antiquity, mathematicians were focused on solving problems related to areas like navigation or surveying land boundaries using right angle triangles. ancient egyptians used a primitive form of arithmetic for tracking goods while babylonian scholars developed an early base 10 numbering system along with complex math tables necessary for surveying their large empire. meanwhile chinese mathematicians figured out how to calculate square roots while indian scholars worked out theoretical ideas about infinity and zero before anyone else did so in europe. later europeans became more interested in developing abstract theories rather than practical applications during the high middle ages when euclidean geometry emerged as a major area of study thanks largely due to works by greek mathematician euclid who wrote elements which outlined various concepts including how lines intersect or circles can be described mathematically among other things. concurrently persian scholar al khwarizmi wrote many influential treatises about algebraic equations including his famed book algorithm from which its namesake derived from algorithm a step by step procedure . during this time islamic advances also left its mark on mathematics particularly through arabic translations of greek texts into their native language making them accessible for later european authors during what we now call the renaissance period when johannes kepler famously established three laws applicable across different astronomical models often credited as ushering forth modern science itself!. . by 1637 french philosopher rene descartes published la geometrie further advancing analytic geometry allowing two dimensional shapes like circles ellipses being understood within cartesian coordinate systems . it wasn't long after this breakthrough when isaac newton",0,0,0.008548746684660704
"the internet has revolutionized the way we communicate, shop, and entertain ourselves however, one area that is often overlooked is its impact on education. online learning has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its convenience and flexibility. even though it offers several advantages over traditional classrooms, there are still some drawbacks as well. one of the major benefits of online learning is the convenience factor students can access courses from nearly any location with an internet connection at any time of day or night. this makes it a great option for those who have busy schedules or cannot easily transport themselves to a physical classroom setting. furthermore, many students find that they benefit from taking classes when they are feeling most alert and productive this may mean completing coursework late at night for some people or during periods where energy levels tend to be higher throughout the day for others. another advantage of online learning revolves around cost savings courses may cost less than their traditional counterparts since institutions do not need to fund utilities like heating or air conditioning related expenses associated with running a physical classroom space, nor must they pay instructors by hour wages all while keeping their own overhead low as well. for many learners living in rural areas without nearby universities or colleges offering specific courses, attending an online class can be far more affordable than relocating elsewhere in order to attend lectures in person this also holds true for international students seeking quality education abroad without having to leave home countries due to prohibitively high costs associated with studying overseas. despite these positives however, there are still some negatives associated with virtual learning experiences as well including reduced socialization opportunities compared to traditional classrooms which can lead students feeling isolated and potential technical issues such as slow connections making it difficult for teachers instructors provide proper instruction if needed assistance isn't readily available through remote means alone like video conferencing platforms just mentioned above . additionally depending on course type selected self motivation might prove challenging since no one is physically present",0,0,0.0005154902877729291

"i disagree with the principal's decision to require all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. while extracurriculars can benefit students, mandating participation removes student choice and autonomy. some key reasons for my position include not all students have the time or energy for extracurriculars on tof of their academic course loads. some need time for jobs, family obligations or independent study. forcing activities could negatively impact their school performance or wellbeing. extracurricular interests vary greatly between individuals. an onesizefitsall approach won't motivate all students and may result in token participation just to fulfill the rule. true engagement comes from personal fashion, not requirements. some students refer focusing on academics without the added time commitment of activities. their priorities should be respected rather than deemed inferior to a well rounded profile. not every faith to success looks the same. scheduling multiple activities can create conflicts that make balanced participation difficult. unrealistic expectations will only lead to frustration on all sides. financial or transportation barriers exist for some that a mandate ignores. not all families can support costs like equipment, travel or lesson fees. while encouraging involvement has benefits, requiring it removes student freedom and risks achieving the offsite of the principal's goal of engagement. a better approach would be providing diverse options and promoting each student's abilities to choose where their interests and circumstances allow. mandates often do more harm than good when it comes to fostering commitment and learning outside the classroom. student choice should be respected.",0,0,0.0071671404322256795

"the impact of technology on the world has been immense over the past few decades. advancements in computers, smartphones, and other devices have changed our daily lives significantly, often for the better. but there are also many potential downsides to these advances that must be considered when evaluating the overall effects of technology on society. one way that technology has had a major impact is by creating new opportunities for businesses and entrepreneurs to succeed. with increasing access to digital platforms like amazon or ebay, it s much easier for individuals to start their own companies from home with minimal cost and effort. this can create an environment where more people can pursue their dreams instead of being stuck in traditional corporate jobs they don t necessarily enjoy or find fulfilling. additionally, advancements in communication tools such as skype or slack make it easier than ever before for remote workers around the globe to collaborate on projects together despite not being physically present in one place at all times. on top of this, technological developments have made it possible for people living far away from each other to stay connected through social media or video calls across long distances something which would have been impossible just a decade ago! however, while this increased connectivity may bring us closer together emotionally speaking it could also lead us down a path towards further isolation due to spending too much time online instead of engaging face to face with our loved ones and community members outside our homes especially during covid 19 . additionally, there are some concerns about how certain technologies might be used by large corporations and governments maliciously against citizens who use them without knowing it such as facial recognition software potentially tracking every movement we make throughout cities without consenting first hand something which has already happened . furthermore , even though automation enabled by recent advances can help minimize labor costs across industries this same automation can displace entire workforces if not implemented responsibly leading workers into unemployment poverty due its ability produce goods services faster than",0,0,8.402431927797784e-05

"self reliance is a concept that is often associated with individualism and personal growth. while some people may define it as the need for each individual to follow their own instincts and ideas, i believe that self reliance is about more than just being independent and relying on oneself. it is about taking ownership of one's life and making decisions that lead to personal growth and development. one of the key benefits of self reliance is that it allows individuals to use their instincts and ideas to their full potential. by relying on their own intuition and decision making skills, people are able to gain more experience and develop their critical thinking abilities. for example, when faced with a problem or challenge, individuals who are self reliant are more likely to take the initiative to find a solution rather than relying on others to solve it for them. another benefit of self reliance is that it helps individuals to become more independent and self sufficient. by taking responsibility for their own lives, people are able to develop a sense of autonomy and self direction. this can be particularly important for those who have experienced trauma or loss, as it allows them to take control of their own lives and make decisions that are in their best interests. however, it is important to recognize that self reliance is not always easy to achieve. for some individuals, it may take time and effort to develop the skills and confidence needed to be independent. additionally, there may be external factors that can make it difficult to achieve self reliance, such as financial constraints or lack of support from others. in conclusion, self reliance is a complex concept that encompasses a range of skills and qualities. while some people may define it as the need for each individual to follow their own instincts and ideas, i believe that it is about more than just being independent and relying on oneself. it is about taking ownership of one's life and making decisions that lead to personal growth and development. ultimately, self reliance is a journey that requires effort, patience, and a willingness to take risks and learn from mistakes.",0,0,2.422470936814207e-06

"with the rise of digital technology, video game streaming has become an increasingly popular form of entertainment. streaming services like twitch allow viewers to watch gamers play their favorite titles live and offer engaging content for those who enjoy the gaming experience. while there are many benefits to this new way of consuming games, there is also some concern surrounding its potential drawbacks. viewers can take advantage of the interactive nature of streaming services in a variety of ways. for example, they have access to chatrooms where they can discuss strategies or skills with other fans while watching as well as provide feedback directly to streamers during their broadcasts something that traditional television could not offer until recently. furthermore, these platforms often feature tournaments and competitions which can be exciting for both participants and spectators alike. additionally, due to its immediacy, many streamers use various forms of commentary and humor throughout their streams which make them more entertaining than traditional media consumption experiences such as movies or tv shows . however, streaming also carries certain risks that come from it being easily accessible over the internet. the most significant risk comes from cyberbullying since streamers are typically very open about themselves on camera there may be those who attack them based on what they say or do regardless if it was meant maliciously or not. this problem has already been seen in online gaming communities such as world of warcraft where players were constantly harassed by trolls or griefers looking for attention thus making it important for stream hosts to remain vigilant when moderating comments within their chats so that incidents like this don't occur again on more mainstream channels . overall , video game streaming is an incredibly exciting way to consume games with a lot of potentials but with some risks associated with it too . to ensure that viewers get the best possible experience out of watching streams , proper moderation should be implemented alongside any technical measures deemed necessary by each platform in order avoid any kind issues regarding cyberbullying . as long as these precautions are taken into account then video",0,0,6.535352448713017e-05
"i disagree with the decision for all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. while extracurricular activities provide many benefits, mandatory participation should not be required. there are several valid reasons why a onesipefitsall extracurricular policy is misguided. not all students have the time, interest or skills for extracurriculars due to other commitments or circumstances outside of school. some students need to work part time jobs to help support their families financially. others may serve as caregivers for siblings after school. forcing these students to take on extracurricular activities would create undue stress and be counterproductive. in addition, extracurricular activities are not equally suitable for all students. many involve physical activities like sports teams that may exclude students with disabilities or health issues. introverted students may feel overwhelmed participating in activities that require extensive social interaction, like student government. forcing participation means students may be placed in environments that undermine rather than promote their wellbeing. instead of mandating extracurricular involvement, a better approach is giving students choices. students could be required to get involved in some form of engagement, but have options that consider their circumstances. for example, they could volunteer within the school or local community on their own schedule. this allows all students to get experience and learn valuable lessons outside the classroom, without imposing blanket rules that do not respect individual differences. overall, while extracurricular activities offer benefits, no single policy can suit every student's needs and talents. requiring uniform participation risks ignoring valid reasons why some students may not be suited for after school clubs or teams. a policy with flexibility built in shows greater respect for students' agency and well rounded development. for these reasons, i do not agree that all students should be mandated to join extracurricular activities. individual choice, not uniform rules, is the best approach.",0,0,0.012406352251972869
"in today's world, technology has become an integral part of our lives. from smartphones to social media, it has revolutionized the way we communicate and interact with each other. while technology has brought many benefits, it has also had a significant impact on our social skills, especially among young generations. in this essay, i will discuss how technology interferes with students' social skills in the classroom, explore bullying on the internet, discuss the dangers of online trolling and fake news posts on social media, and propose methods to reduce the limitation of human contact due to technology. one of the most significant impacts of technology on social skills is the way it has changed the way we communicate. with the rise of social media and instant messaging, people are now more likely to communicate through screens than in person. this has led to a decline in face to face communication, which is essential for developing social skills. in the classroom, this can be particularly problematic, as students are less likely to interact with each other and build relationships. bullying on the internet is another significant issue that has arisen due to technology. with the rise of social media, it has become easier for bullies to harass and torment their victims. one real life example of this is the case of monica lewinsky, who was subjected to intense bullying and harassment after her affair with former president bill clinton. this bullying continued for years, and lewinsky has since become an advocate for victims of online harassment. online trolling and fake news posts on social media are also significant dangers that have arisen due to technology. trolls are people who intentionally harass and provoke others online, often using fake accounts or multiple accounts to amplify their impact. fake news posts are another issue, as they can spread false information and incite panic or violence. these dangers have become increasingly prevalent in recent years, and it is essential to be aware of them. to reduce the limitation of human contact due to technology, there are several methods that can be implemented. one approach is to encourage face to face communication in the classroom. teachers can organize activities that require students to interact with each other, such as group projects or debates. another approach is to educate students about the dangers of online bullying and harassment, and to provide them with the tools to report and block ab",0,0,7.243251675102277e-06
"the facial action coding system facs is a revolutionary technology that can decode human emotions. the technology has sparked a proposal to apply it in educational settings, where it can potentially improve learning experiences for students. however, the idea of using this technology in classrooms is a subject of debate, as it raises significant concerns about privacy and practicality. on the one hand, the facs system can provide teachers with an additional tool to understand their students' emotions better. teachers can use this technology to identify confused or bored expressions on their students' faces and adjust their teaching methods accordingly. this could potentially result in more personalized and engaging lessons for students. on the other hand, there are concerns about the invasion of privacy that this technology could bring. students bring a multitude of personal experiences and emotions to the classroom that may not be directly related to the classroom environment. the application of emotion detection technology in such a setting could lead to an invasive scrutiny of students' private emotional states, potentially exacerbating their distress. moreover, implementing facs technology in each classroom would be impractical and expensive for most educational institutions. in my opinion, the use of facs in the classroom is not valuable. as humans, we naturally possess the ability to gauge emotions through facial expressions, making this technology redundant. in addition, the financial and privacy costs associated far outweigh any potential benefits. in education, maintaining a human approach is paramount, and relying on technology to read students' emotions undermines that. while the technology is intriguing, it's crucial to approach its application with care and respect privacy, emphasizing human centric teaching methods where emotional understanding and connection are crucial.",0,0,2.5778586434604375e-05

"driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, are self driving vehicles that rely on a combination of sensors, cameras, and software to navigate roads without the need for human control. these innovative cars have the potential to revolutionize transportation and improve safety on our roads. one of the main benefits of driverless cars is their ability to significantly reduce the number of traffic accidents caused by human errors. by eliminating the possibility of distracted driving, drunk driving, or fatigue behind the wheel, these vehicles could significantly improve traffic safety and lower insurance rates. another advantage of autonomous cars is their potential to improve accessibility for individuals with disabilities or limited mobility. these vehicles could allow people with visual impairments or limited physical abilities to travel independently, increasing their overall quality of life. furthermore, driverless cars could help alleviate traffic congestion by enabling more efficient and coordinated traffic flows. by communicating with each other, autonomous vehicles could reduce travel times and minimize the need for parking spaces in dense urban areas. however, there are also some challenges associated with the widespread adoption of driverless cars. one concern is the potential for hackers to gain control of these vehicles, compromising their safety. manufacturers and governments must work together to develop robust security measures to address these concerns. additionally, the implementation of driverless cars could lead to job losses within the transportation industry, particularly for taxi and truck drivers. governments will need to develop strategies for retraining and reintegrating displaced workers into new job sectors. in conclusion, while there are both opportunities and challenges associated with driverless cars, their potential to improve transportation safety, accessibility, and efficiency is undeniable. as these vehicles become more prevalent in the coming years, it is essential to address the various concerns and work collaboratively to ensure their successful integration into our society.",0,0,1.546845424179732e-06
"venus, the second planet from the sun, is often referred to as earth's sister planet because of its similar size and mass. despite their similarities, venus has a very different environment than earth. in this essay, we will explore some of venus' unique features and characteristics that make it stand out in our solar system. atmosphere and surface temperature venus has a thick atmosphere, made primarily of carbon dioxide, which contributes to its extreme surface temperature. at an average temperature of 864 degrees fahrenheit 462 degrees celsius , venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. this high temperature is due to the greenhouse effect caused by the abundance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which traps heat and prevents it from dissipating. clouds and storms venus' atmosphere consists mainly of carbon dioxide with small amounts of nitrogen, and it is covered by dense, thick layers of clouds. these clouds are primarily made up of sulfuric acid droplets, which are created by sunlight reacting with sulfur in the atmosphere. the clouds on venus are constantly shifting, with some areas experiencing storms and lightning that is 10 times more powerful than earth's. venus has no liquid water on its surface due to the incredibly high temperatures and pressures. instead, it is covered by solid, volcanic rock that is constantly being resurfaced by the planet's volcanoes. venus has a very slow rotation, which means it takes 243 earth days to complete one rotation on its axis. this slow rotation also causes venus to have a retrograde rotation, meaning it rotates in the opposite direction compared to most planets. exploration efforts despite its similarities to earth, venus remains a mysterious planet, with only limited exploration by spacecraft. nasa's mariner 2 mission was the first spacecraft to successfully visit venus in 1962. since then, multiple probes have been sent to explore venus, but they have faced numerous challenges, such as the extreme temperatures, thick atmosphere, and harsh environment. in conclusion, venus is a fascinating and unique planet in our solar system, with its extreme surface temperatures, dense atmosphere, and volcanic landscape. as we continue to explore this sister planet of earth, we may uncover more about our own planet's origins and history.",0,0,0.01292808126690342

"there is no right or wrong answer when it comes to this topic, as people have different opinions on the matter. however, i do believe that famous people are treated unfairly by the media, and they should be given more privacy. there are a few reasons why i think this is the case. first of all, the media often focuses on the negative aspects of a celebrity's life, rather than the positive. for example, if a celebrity makes a mistake, the media is quick to report on it. this can be very damaging to their reputation. secondly, the media often publishes private information about celebrities without their consent. this can be very embarrassing for them and can cause a lot of stress. finally, the media often hounds celebrities for interviews and photos. this can be very intrusive and can make it difficult for them to lead a normal life. in conclusion, i believe that the media should give celebrities more privacy. they should focus on the positive aspects of their lives, and they should not publish private information without their consent.",0,0,8.615028442562576e-07

"i think that the technolgy really can't tell ore actual emotions. i believe this because some people can just pretend to be smiling and look happy but you really dont know what they are actually feeling. they coukd be sad, angry, depressed we can never know what they truly feel just by the look of someone. some people just pretend to be okay because they dont want people asking or worrying. but also sometimes you can tell that there is actually wrong with them because the maybe try to act like they are okay but they really cant hold it for so long. technology can maybe believe that they know someones emotions by their faces expressions but the inside is what actually matters if you really know how someone feels. but also sometimes it can be very confusing because they are showing a lot of diffferent emotions and they are maybe confused themself. but thats okay a lot of people feel that way. technology is very smart and uts becoming bigger as time goes by but i know and believe that technology cant really know how someone is actually feeling. they can tell by the face but not the true feeling. does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion? maybe if you're looking at yourself in the mirror and you're feeling sad maybe you can see it in your face because its actually you feeling sad. but someone really doesnt know just by the face just you cause its you. and its the same for technology they really cant tell what your emotion is just by looking at you. unless you're really happy and sometimes you can actually show an emotion inside and out and if your computer can tell an actual emotion thats true well maybe because you really are feeling happy, sad, etc. so i believe that technogly really cont tell someones emotions.",1,1,0.9971335415384334

my argument is about how the landform is just a natural occurrence. i may have proof to why it may just be another hoax n.a.s.a. may be involved in. if you look closely at the pictures took within the time period of 19762001 you can tell there has been a mistake because you look at the face on mars ana you think what!? is that true?. i ao not think it is real because if you look at the pictures from 19762001 you can tell there has been an increase in technology such as photography. if you were to look at the pictures then you can easily tell it's not a face because for one there is no face there anymore another reason is it looks like a mesa as one reporter said. my personal opinion is that it was just something to get the community arouse ana it air indeed. in the passage it said it even haunted grocery lines for 25 years! ana also it player its part in movies ana things like that. ana only recently in 20102016 has there been any proof there has been any life or there may be any life there whatsoever. the reason of that is they found a river or something i can't exactly remember. ana also they n.a.s.a. aon't believe that there could be any life there because the atmosphere is so in ana so hot they believe that it would be hara for something to grow an alive on the planet mars. that is why i believe it was either a hoax or a misunderstanding. thank you very much.,1,1,0.999921450054349

"the electoral college has long been an essential component of the united states' presidential election process. its primary purpose is to provide each state with a degree of influence in determining the nation's highest office. the electoral college consists of a group of individuals, typically known as electors, who are appointed based on a state's congressional representation and overall population. the system of electoral college has been a topic of debate and controversy, with some arguing it works effectively, while others contend that it has significant drawbacks. on one hand, the electoral college has several advantages 1. it ensures a more equitable distribution of voting power among the states, regardless of their population size. 2. it helps maintain a sense of balance between the urban and rural areas of the united states, since the electoral college votes are allocated proportionally according to the size of a state's congressional representation. 3. the electoral college encourages campaigning in various states, as candidates must win a diverse array of electoral votes to secure the presidency. 4. the electoral college helps prevent the possibility of a single candidate winning every state, thereby avoiding a winner takes all scenario. however, the electoral college also faces criticism due to the following reasons 1. it can result in a candidate winning the presidency despite losing the popular vote. this has happened multiple times in american history, leading to claims of unfairness and a lack of democratic legitimacy. 2. the electoral college can lead to swing states receiving disproportionate attention from political campaigns, while other states with fewer electoral votes may be overlooked. this could lead to unequal representation and a lack of accountability for candidates in less significant states. in conclusion, while the electoral college serves some important functions within the united states' presidential election process, it also has several drawbacks and limitations that have been the subject of debate and criticism. the question of whether the electoral college works remains a contentious issue, with various perspectives held by different individuals and groups within the country.",0,0,0.00010003224936709426
"studying venus remains worth pursuit despite dangers the author makes a compelling case that studying venus remains a worthy scientific endeavor, in spite of the planet's extremely hazardous conditions. while venus presents clear dangers to any potential explorers or equipment, the potential scientific rewards outweigh these risks. several key pieces of evidence from the article support this view. first, venus remains one of the least explored planets in our solar system, with many fundamental questions still unanswered about its composition and evolution. by better understanding venus, scientists hope to gain valuable insights into the formation of terrestrial planets like earth. additionally, the article notes venus's surface represents an opportunity to study how a greenhouse effect might transform an otherwise habitable world into a scorched landscape. these insights could prove crucial for predicting and mitigating climate change on earth. perhaps most significantly, the article describes recent technological advances that have helped enable more durable probes and exploration methods tailored to venus's environment. citing projects like the proposed da vinci mission, the author implies that while planetary protection remains an obstacle, it is an obstacle scientists are actively working to overcome. these efforts suggest the risk of exploring venus, while serious, may be decreasing with every new material or design breakthrough. as long as researchers proceed carefully based on accumulated knowledge, even incremental discoveries on venus could reshape our understanding of planetary science. in conclusion, while venus's extreme climate presents clear hazards, the potential scientific payoffs from exploring this planet justifies continued efforts to push the boundaries of what is possible there. by highlighting both the unanswered scientific questions about venus and ways new technologies are counteracting its dangers, the author builds a persuasive case that studying venus remains worthwhile. with diligence and steady progress, venus's mysteries may still be within humanity's grasp.",0,0,0.00015308490664309486
"the question of whether the electoral college works is a controversial one. on one hand, the electoral college serves as the process that determines the winner of the presidential election. it ensures that the candidate with the most support from the states wins, even if they did not win the popular vote. this system was designed to prevent the election of a president solely by popular vote, which could lead to candidates focusing solely on populous urban areas. however, the electoral college has also been criticized for being outdated and undemocratic. it was established in 1787 when the united states consisted of only 13 states, each having an equal say in the election process. today, with a significantly larger population and diverse political interests, some argue that the electoral college does not accurately represent the popular vote. in the 2016 election, for example, donald trump won the presidency despite losing the popular vote by almost 2.9 million votes. this discrepancy between the popular vote and the electoral college vote has led to calls for reform or elimination of the electoral college. in conclusion, the electoral college works to some extent, as it ensures a candidate must garner support from a diverse range of states to win the presidency. however, its effectiveness in accurately reflecting the popular will of the people is questionable, as seen in recent presidential elections. as such, there are ongoing debates and discussions about the need for reform or abolishment of the electoral college.",0,0,0.0009404397324573476

"while distance learning has benefits, attending classes in person is still preferable for most students. here are a few reasons why firstly, learning from home can be distracting. it's harder for students to focus without leaving their homes and neighborhoods where other activities and social media are easily accessible. this makes concentrating on course work challenging. in a physical classroom, the environment is designed for learning without these kinds of distractions. secondly, distance learning makes real time collaboration more difficult. part of the classroom experience involves interacting and working with other students. brainstorming ideas, debating topics, and group projects are best done face to face where non verbal cues and instant feedback allows for a free flow of ideas. online it's easier for communication to break down or delay responses. thirdly, attending class in person promotes better time management habits. when homework is completed at home on a personal schedule, it's difficult for students to separate school and play time. however, being physically present at school helps students learn to set aside dedicated time for their studies without procrastination. this discipline is important for academic success. while distance learning has its place, especially for specialized circumstances, the traditional classroom environment generally does more to support a student's social, emotional and academic development during their formative years. for most students, the benefits of in person interaction and supervision outweigh any advantages of learning from home. a blended model that incorporates some online elements, but keeps core classes at school, is likely best for achieving educational outcomes and preparing youth for future challenges.",0,0,0.0010925960082171088

"the electoral college is a system used in the united states to determine who will be president. it is made up of electors who are appointed by the political parties and vote for president. the candidate who gets the majority of electoral votes wins the election. but does it really work? is it fair and representative of the american people? these are important questions to consider when examining the electoral college. the electoral college was established in the constitution in order to balance out the interests of states and urban and rural areas. the founding fathers believed that smaller states would be more fairly represented by having their own electors, while larger and more populous states would be able to have greater influence through their electors. however, this system has the potential to distort the will of the majority. if a candidate wins the popular vote nationwide, but loses the electoral vote, they will not become president. this can undermine the principles of one person, one vote, and representativeness of the government as a whole. additionally, the electoral college can be influenced by factors such as voter suppression, unequal representation, and gerrymandering. in many states, laws are implemented that restrict access to the ballot box, resulting in lower turnout among certain groups. this can lead to a candidate with a narrow win, even though they did not have the support of the majority of voters. similarly, the way that electoral votes are allocated can skew the system. for example, california and texas have a combined total of 55 electoral votes, while states like arizona and mississippi have a combined total of 11. this means that california and texas alone could be enough to put a candidate over the top. another problem with the electoral college is the lack of representation for certain groups in the country. the popular vote may not always accurately reflect the will of the entire country, but the electoral vote fails to adequately represent it as well. for example, a candidate who wins the popular vote in a state that only has a few electoral votes may not be representative of the",0,0,0.0007102160510151441

"i believe that video games can contribute to violent behavior. the reason for this is that many popular video games contain a lot of violence and aggressive content. for example, games like grand theft auto and call of duty involve shooting, killing, and other violent activities. when players are exposed to this kind of content over a long period of time, it may desensitize them to violence and make them more likely to engage in aggressive behavior. additionally, some studies have suggested that there may be a link between playing violent video games and increased aggression in real life. however, it's important to note that not all video games are violent, and not all players who play violent games become aggressive. there are many factors that contribute to behavior, and video games are just one of them. ultimately, i think it's up to parents and guardians to monitor the types of games their children are playing and limit their exposure to violent content. it's also important for game developers to be mindful of the impact their games can have on players and to create games that are appropriate for different age groups. in conclusion, while video games may not be the sole cause of violent behavior, they can certainly contribute to it. we need to be aware of the content in the games we play and make responsible choices about what we expose ourselves and others to.",0,0,4.7938620032937445e-06

"driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, are a rapidly advancing technology that promises to revolutionize transportation and change the way we travel. these cars use sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence to navigate roads and traffic without the need for a human driver. the concept of driverless cars has been around since the 1930s, but it wasn't until recent advancements in computer technology and machine learning that this innovation started gaining traction. the benefits of driverless cars are numerous and can potentially lead to safer roads, reduced traffic congestion, and improved accessibility for those who cannot drive themselves. 1. safety driverless cars have a significant safety advantage over human driven cars, as they are designed to follow traffic rules, avoid obstacles, and react more quickly to unexpected situations. they also eliminate human errors, which contribute to a majority of accidents on the road. 2. traffic congestion autonomous vehicles are designed to communicate with one another, which allows them to optimize their movements and flow smoothly through traffic. this can potentially lead to reduced commute times and less congestion overall. 3. accessibility self driving cars have the potential to provide transportation options for those who cannot drive themselves, such as the elderly and people with disabilities. this increased accessibility can significantly impact people's lives by improving their mobility and independence. despite these advantages, there are still challenges that need to be overcome before autonomous vehicles become mainstream. some of these challenges include 1. technical hurdles developing the technology to make autonomous cars safe and efficient requires extensive research, testing, and refining. 2. legal and regulatory barriers governments worldwide need to create clear regulations and guidelines to ensure the safe deployment of driverless cars. 3. public acceptance many people are skeptical about the idea of driverless cars and may need time and education to embrace this new technology. in conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize transportation and make our lives easier and safer. while there are still challenges to overcome, the progress made so far in this field is encouraging, and we can expect to see autonomous vehicles becoming a common sight on our roads in the near future.",0,0,9.219255649788541e-05

"the art of bonsai is an ancient tradition that has been practiced for thousands of years in many parts of the world. originating in china and then spreading to japan and other parts of asia, bonsai are cultivated miniature trees grown in containers that mimic the shape and form found on larger trees growing naturally outdoors. although one can easily buy a pre made bonsai from many stores today, taking up this hobby requires patience, dedication and a great deal of knowledge about plant care, pruning techniques, potting soil mixtures and more. one must start with selecting the right tree species for their climate zone. bonsai artists typically prefer broad leaved evergreen plants such as junipers or pines due to their ability to quickly respond to pruning with new growth each season however there are also some deciduous varieties like maples or elms which may suit certain climates better than others. once they ve chosen their species it is important to understand how much light will be available depending on where they live too much sunlight can burn foliage while too little will stunt growth development so finding just the right balance is key!. when it comes time for planting your chosen tree into its potting container you should take special care not to cause any unnecessary stress by creating tight roots systems within cramped spaces it s best practice here to use coarse soil mixes composed mostly of mineral particles as opposed organic materials since these allow water retention yet permit good drainage at same time. in addition regular fertilization throughout year will ensure adequate nutrition levels remain consistent during cold weather months when natural sources might otherwise become scarce. though most beginners find difficulty getting started with bonsai due lack experience or proper resources necessary execute successful cultivation efforts over long term those who do find success often express unmatched sense satisfaction knowing that have created something unique beautiful through skillful manipulation nature itself from small seed sprouts entire forest flooring vast array colors textures",0,0,0.013012069224378054

"advertisements are a ubiquitous part of modern life, and they are designed to persuade us to say products. however, many people believe that most advertisements make products seem much setter than they really are. in my opinion, this is generally true, and there are several reasons why. firstly, advertisements often use exaggerated or misleading claims to make products seem more appealing. for example, a shampoo advertisement might claim that their product can make your hair 10 times stronger or 100 smoother, even though these claims are impossible to measure objectively. similarly, a food advertisement might show a surgery that looks much larger and more delicious than the actual product you receive at the restaurant. these tactics are designed to create a sense of desire and urgency in the viewer, but they can also see deceptive and manipulative. secondly, advertisements often focus on the positive aspects of a product while downplaying or ignoring its negative aspects. for example, a car advertisement might emphasize the vehicle's sleek design and powerful engine, but ignore it's poor fuel efficiency or high maintenance costs. similarly, a beauty product advertisement might highlight the product's ability to reduce wrinkles or blemishes, but ignore the potential side effects or long term risks. by presenting an one sided view of the product, advertisers can create a false impression of it's overall quality and value. finally, advertisements often use emotional appeals to persuade viewers to say products. for example, a perfume advertisement might show a romantic couple in a beautiful setting, suggesting that using the product will make you more attractive and desirable. similarly, a charity advertisement might show images of suffering children or animals, appealing to viewers' sense of compassion and empathy. while these emotional appeals can see powerful and effective, they can also see manipulative and exploitative. in conclusion, i believe that most advertisements make products seem much setter than they really are. by using exaggerated or misleading claims, downplaying negative aspects, and appealing to viewers' emotions, advertisers can create a false impression of a product's quality and value. while some advertisements may see more honest and informative than others, it is important for consumers to se aware of these tactics and to approach advertisements with a critical eye. by doing so, we can make more informed decisions about the products we say and the companies we support.",0,0,2.2141649983195938e-06

"the electoral college is a unique aspect of american democracy, designed to ensure fair representation and balance between states with larger and smaller populations. while it has some flaws, it still serves its primary function of electing the president and vice president of the united states. the electoral college was created by the founding fathers in the united states constitution, as an alternative to a popular vote. it assigns electoral votes to each state based on the number of members in congress senators and representatives . the total number of electoral votes in the united states is 538 the majority 270 is required for a candidate to win. one of the main criticisms of the electoral college is that it does not directly reflect the popular vote. in some cases, a candidate can win the popular vote but lose the election due to a lack of electoral votes. this happened in the 2000 presidential election when george w. bush was elected president despite receiving fewer popular votes than his opponent, al gore. another issue is that the electoral college gives disproportionate power to smaller, less populous states. these states have fewer electoral votes but are still equally represented in the electoral college. this means that a candidate can potentially win the election with less than 50 of the popular vote, as was the case in both bush gore and trump clinton elections. despite these flaws, the electoral college serves its primary function of electing the president and vice president. it ensures that the interests of smaller states are represented, while also preventing a handful of highly populated states from dominating the election. additionally, it provides a safeguard against potential election fraud and manipulation, as electoral votes from each state are awarded by the state legislatures. in conclusion, the electoral college does work, albeit with some shortcomings. it has served the united states well since its inception, and while there may be better ways to elect the president, the electoral college remains a crucial part of the american democratic process.",0,0,0.0012234199051624998

"choosing a career at a young age is it the right decision? the decision to choose a career at a young age can be a challenging one for many students. on the one hand, some students may feel confident and excited about their future prospects and be eager to start planning their career paths. on the other hand, others may feel overwhelmed or unsure about their goals and be hesitant to make such a significant decision. while some people may believe that choosing a career at a young age is a good idea, there are also those who argue that it can be a hindrance to personal growth and development. for example, students who are forced to make a decision about their future at a young age may miss out on important experiences and opportunities that could help them to better understand their interests and passions. additionally, students who are pressured to choose a career may feel like they are boxing themselves into a specific path, which could limit their future possibilities. however, there are also several benefits to choosing a career at a young age. for one, students who are able to identify their passions and interests early on may be better equipped to pursue careers that they are truly passionate about. this could lead to greater job satisfaction and a more fulfilling life. additionally, students who are able to plan their careers early on may be better able to prepare for the necessary education and training required to achieve their goals. ultimately, the decision to choose a career at a young age is a personal one that should be made with careful consideration of one's own goals and aspirations. while there are certainly pros and cons to this decision, it is ultimately up to each individual to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks and make the best decision for their own future.",0,0,1.5280672060496947e-06

"dear principal smith, u am i writing to express my concerns about the proposed policy change that would require students to maintain at least a b average in order to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities. while maintaining good grades is important, u do not think tying eligibility to such a high standard is fair or will have the intended effects. requiring a b average will negatively impact many students who currently have a c average. extracurricular activities are important for developing skills, staying active, managing stress, and finding belonging in the school community. for some students, participating in a sport or club is what keeps them motivated and engaged in their overall education. taking this away could damage their self esteem and reduce their commitment to academic improvement. a c average already shows that students are passing their classes, and participating in after school activities may help them elevate their performance over time. imposing a b average could create unrealistic pressure that backfires. students may feel so stressed about keeping their grades up that their performance declines. they may lose focus on learning for learning's sake and instead prioritize grades over comprehension. some students simply struggle more in certain subjects no matter how hard they try, through no fault of their own. punishing these students seems unfair. a better approach would be to create incentive programs rather than use strict eligibility rules. for example, any student who raises their grade from a c to a b within a quarter could have activities fees reduced or waived. tutoring and mentoring programs could also help those committed to improving. this rewards effort and progress over an arbitrary average. un closing, while maintaining academic standards is understandable, tying extracurricular eligibility to a b average will harm more students than it helps. u urge you to reconsider this policy and instead try incentive programs that motivate without punishing. the developmental wellbeing of students should be the top priority. thank you for your consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.02137597627830311

"marijuana legalization has been a topic of heated debate in recent years. proponents of legalization argue that it would have numerous benefits, such as generating tax revenue, reducing crime rates, and providing medical relief for patients suffering from various ailments. however, opponents argue that it could lead to increased drug abuse, health problems, and impaired driving. after careful consideration, i firmly believe that marijuana should not be legalized. firstly, the legalization of marijuana could lead to an increase in drug abuse. while proponents argue that legalization would allow for better regulation and control of the drug, it could also make it more accessible to the general public, including minors. this could potentially lead to a rise in drug addiction and related health problems. for example, studies have shown that marijuana use can lead to memory impairment, decreased lung function, and even psychosis in some cases. legalizing the drug could make it easier for individuals to obtain and abuse it, ultimately causing more harm than good. secondly, legalization could result in an increase in impaired driving incidents. marijuana use can impair judgment, reaction time, and motor skills, making it dangerous for individuals to operate a vehicle while under its influence. if marijuana were legalized, more people may feel comfortable using it before getting behind the wheel, putting themselves and others at risk. this could lead to an increase in accidents and fatalities on our roads. lastly, the medical benefits of marijuana are often overstated by proponents of legalization. while it is true that marijuana can provide some relief for patients suffering from certain conditions, such as chronic pain or nausea, there are often safer and more effective treatments available. additionally, the long term effects of marijuana use on patients are not fully understood, and it could potentially do more harm than good in some cases. in conclusion, while there are arguments in favor of marijuana legalization, the potential risks and negative consequences outweigh any potential benefits. legalizing the drug could lead to increased drug abuse, impaired driving incidents, and even health problems for users. therefore, i strongly believe that marijuana should remain illegal.",0,0,2.315286405458414e-06

"venus, the second planet from the sun, has fascinated humans throughout history. with its dense atmosphere, extreme temperatures, and mysterious surface, venus remains a subject of curiosity. let's delve into the exploration of our celestial sister, venus. venus's atmosphere venus's thick atmosphere, composed mostly of carbon dioxide, makes it challenging for spacecraft to survive on the surface. the pressure at the planet's surface is about 90 times that of earth, while its average temperature reaches a scorching 864 degrees fahrenheit 462 degrees celsius . these factors have made it challenging for spacecraft to survive on the planet's surface for extended periods. venus's surface despite these difficulties, various spacecraft have been sent to study venus from orbit. the soviet spacecraft venera 7 was the first to successfully land on the planet's surface on december 15, 1970. since then, numerous missions have been launched, such as nasa's magellan mission in the mid 1990s. magellan orbited venus and provided valuable data about the planet's geology, including the discovery of volcanic activity. recent exploration in recent years, nasa's messenger mission mercury, surface, space environment, geochemistry, and ranging has been studying the inner solar system, including venus. in addition to providing valuable data on the planet's surface and atmosphere, messenger's findings may also help scientists better understand earth's formation. venus is a fascinating world with a unique history and composition. as our exploration continues, we may uncover more secrets about earth's sister planet and the origins of our solar system.",0,0,0.011882055078851326
"the school board is considering adding one and a half hours to school each day. while this may seem like a good idea on the surface, i believe it would have negative consequences for both students and teachers. for students, adding extra hours to the school day could disrupt their schedules and limit their ability to participate in extracurricular activities. many students have sports or tutoring after school, and if they were forced to give up these activities, it would be a significant loss for them. additionally, students need time to relax and recharge, and adding more school time could lead to burnout and decreased academic performance. teachers would also be affected by the longer school day. they already work long hours, grading papers and preparing lessons, and adding more time to the school day would make it even more difficult for them to maintain a work life balance. teachers need breaks to recharge and spend time with their families, and adding more school time would make it harder for them to achieve this. furthermore, students and teachers already have a lot of work to do, and adding more school time could lead to increased stress and decreased academic performance. students already have a lot of homework and tests, and adding more school time could lead to them becoming overwhelmed and not being able to keep up. similarly, teachers already have a lot of work to do, and adding more school time could lead to them becoming burnt out and not being able to provide the best education for their students. in conclusion, while the school board may have good intentions, adding one and a half hours to the school day would have negative consequences for both students and teachers. it would disrupt their schedules, limit their ability to participate in extracurricular activities, and lead to increased stress and decreased academic performance. instead, the school board should focus on finding ways to support students and teachers in their work, rather than trying to cram more school time into their already busy days.",0,0,0.0017330848128571054

"i don't think completely driverless cars are an good idea at all, for many reasons. the price on those cars would be an outrageous amount that only rich people would be able to afford. a driverless car is also just another way for people to be lazy, someone is always trying to invent something just so people can do less work and i think that's honestly really stupid. i don't think it would be very fun to have a driverless car anyway, all you would do is sit in a car until you aet where your alina. in my opinion it's more fun to drive at your own speed and physically on your own. it's like everyone wants the world to run on robots! what fun is that though? i don't see why anybody would want to depend on a robot to do literally everything for them, that's just no fun. besides right after they make these driverless cars they're alina to be on to the next invention trying to make something even better than the last, along the way making the world an even lazier place.",1,1,0.9958082145607269
"therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks . this is just one of the examples that the author uses to support the idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. the author is clear when he describes venus being an important planet to discover. in the text, it says astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earthlike planet in our solar system . they also state, the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters . the author is giving background on venus and how earthlike it used to be. this is the important part of venus in the article that the author is describing. next, the author makes sure to describe the dangerous part of venus too. for example, he says a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon divide blankets venus. even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere . the author is describing that venus is a very dangerous planet to discover. as in the tests, it says ...temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet . he also describes previous missions to venus, stating ...since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decades . this is more evidence that the author supports the idea of studying venus despite the dangers. in conclusion, the author does a excellent job supporting the idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. the author supports this idea with evidence from the text. he concludes his idea at the end by stating, our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation .",1,1,0.9469059638398931

"dear principal, i believe that only allowing students with a grade average of at least a b is unfair. students should be able to participate in the activities they enjoy no matter what, and they should not be discriminated if their grades aren't at the tip of the peak. there are few sources in town besides school that these kids can take part in a sport or other activity, and taking away their activities that they enjoy is taking away their rights. if a student has low grades, but loves basketball with all their heart, it would be terrible to take that away from them. everybody is good at something, and bad at others, it's part of being human. a student may not have the best grades, because education may be their weakness and athletics is their strength. i believe that in the long run, it is important that a student is successful in their future life. if someone was set on pursuing an athletic career, why do they have to have excellent grades in classes. as long as they are trying their best in school, they deserve their rights. a proper education is very important for success, but if they are the best in what they want to do for the rest of their lives, that should be all that matters. what may improve the grades of athletes is scheduling practices at convenient times, which allow them to get all their school work completed before practice. doing so will allow the students to focus more on their work. another option is to cut practices shorter. if they are not as long, students will have more time to do the things they need to in order to help their grades. it is important that kids stay healthy and active, and not allowing them to play sports is depriving them of exercise that is needed for them to grow. people who exercise on a regular basis are happier people, and of course, healthier people. i hope you take my concern into consideration, because i know many other students who would agree with a lot of the things i mentioned. sincerely, student name",1,1,0.990725575284195

"there is no question that advertisements often make products seem much better than they really are. for example, an ad for a new car may focus on its sleek design, powerful engine, and luxurious interior, while downplaying the fact that it is expensive to maintain and may not be as reliable as a more affordable model. however, i do not believe that this is always the case. in some cases, advertisements may be honest about the downsides of a product, but still make it'seem appealing to potential buyers. for example, an ad for a new mattress may mention that it is expensive but also highlight it's many benefits, such as its ability to reduce back pain. ultimately, whether an advertisement makes a product seem better than it really is depends on the specific product and the specific ad. some ads are definitely more honest than others, but it is difficult to make a general statement about this.",0,0,1.2758975600558751e-05

"a positive attitude in achieving success in life. having a positive attitude is crucial for achieving success in life. it is a well established fact that our attitudes and mindsets shape our thoughts, actions, and ultimately our outcomes. a positive attitude can be the driving force behind our motivation, productivity, and overall well being. in this essay, i will explore the impact of having a positive attitude on success in life, outline the rewards that come from having a positive attitude, explain how having a positive attitude can help a person overcome obstacles, compare and contrast the consequences of having a positive attitude against a negative, and summarize the importance of having a positive attitude in achieving success. firstly, research has shown that people with a positive attitude tend to have a higher likelihood of achieving their goals and succeeding in life. they are more optimistic, resilient, and adaptable, which enables them to handle setbacks and challenges more effectively. for instance, a study conducted by the university of pennsylvania found that people with a positive attitude were more likely to achieve their fitness goals than those with a negative attitude. this is because they were more motivated, disciplined, and committed to their goals. secondly, having a positive attitude can bring numerous rewards, including improved mental and physical health, better relationships, and increased job satisfaction. when we have a positive outlook, we tend to focus on the good things in life, which can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. we also tend to be more optimistic about the future, which can lead to better decision making and risk taking. additionally, people with a positive attitude tend to have stronger social connections and are more likely to form and maintain healthy relationships. finally, having a positive attitude can lead to increased job satisfaction, as it can lead to better communication, collaboration, and productivity in the workplace. thirdly, having a positive attitude can help a person overcome obstacles and setbacks. when we have a positive outlook, we tend to view challenges as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than threats to our success. this can help us develop a growth mindset, which enables us to embrace failure as a natural part of the learning process. additionally, people with a positive attitude tend to be more resilient and adaptable, which allows them to bounce back from setbacks and continue pursuing their goals. fourthly,",0,0,5.242645929590354e-05

"dear senator, as a 9th grade student, i am writing to express my opinion on the electoral college system in presidential elections. after reading various sources, including the text provided, i have come to the conclusion that the electoral college system should be abolished in favor of a popular vote system. the main argument in favor of the electoral college is that it protects state interests and federalism. however, this argument is no longer relevant in today's society. the system was originally established as a concession to slaveholders and based on assumptions about public information access that are no longer valid. in the 21st century, we have access to information and the ability to communicate easily across the country, making it unnecessary to rely on electors to make informed decisions on our behalf. another argument against the electoral college is that it can lead to confusion and unfairness, as seen in the 2000 election. the possibility of faithless electors or a tie in electoral votes throws the election to congress, which can lead to disasters. in contrast, a popular vote system would reflect the will of the people more accurately and avoid these potential issues. some critics argue that a popular vote system would lead to recounts and issues with third party candidates. however, these concerns can be addressed through the implementation of a ranked choice voting system, which would allow voters to rank their choices and ensure that the winner is elected by a true majority. in conclusion, the electoral college system is outdated and unfair. it is time for it to be abolished in favor of a popular vote system that accurately reflects the will of the people. i urge you to consider the consensus among critics and take steps towards making this change a reality. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.0014996359566135122

"with the rapid pace of technological advancements, driverless cars have become a topic of much discussion and debate. as a student in the 10th grade, i firmly believe that the introduction of driverless cars should be approached with caution, considering the potential safety, dependency, economic and accessibility concerns, legal, and ethical dilemmas, that come along with the concept. the safety of passengers, pedestrians, and other drivers is of utmost importance when it comes to transportation. the safety debate surrounding driverless cars raises valid concerns about relying on machines to make crucial decisions. while manufacturers may assure that the cars will have advanced warning systems, there is no guarantee that these measures will be effective, especially if the driver becomes too dependent on the automation. additionally, the cost of developing such advanced technology could lead to exclusivity, creating socio economic divides and further questioning the practicality of producing vehicles that are not accessible to the masses. furthermore, the dependency on technology is a growing concern as society is becoming increasingly reliant. the progression towards automated vehicles is indicative of this trend and could lead to a disconnection from the act of driving and a lack of situational awareness. additionally, legal and ethical dilemmas may arise due to blurred lines of liability in the event of technology failure resulting in accidents. in conclusion, while driverless cars are a significant technological feat, their adoption must be approached with caution. it is essential to consider the impact of driverless cars on society, the economy, and individual autonomy. balancing innovation with preservation of human independence, skill, and safety is necessary to ensure a thoughtful and progressive journey towards a driverless future.",0,0,1.8823644306727457e-05

"the advancements in artificial intelligence ai have been astounding. in recent years, ai has become increasingly prevalent in many different fields, including healthcare and education. while ai has the potential to revolutionize these industries, it is also important to remember that there are some risks associated with it as well. in healthcare, ai can provide doctors with valuable insights into patient data by analyzing large amounts of information quickly and accurately. this improved access to key health metrics could help improve diagnosis accuracy while reducing wait times for patients. additionally, ai can be used to automate mundane tasks such as paperwork or scheduling appointments which would reduce human error and free up time for physicians so they can better focus on their patients needs. however, there are still several ethical considerations surrounding the use of ai in healthcare this includes ensuring user privacy and safety when dealing with sensitive medical data as well as preventing bias from creeping into decision making processes due to algorithms being programmed improperly or suited towards particular groups of people instead of being based solely on facts alone. these concerns must be addressed before any progress is made regarding implementation in a clinical setting . on the other hand, educational applications of artificial intelligence offer great promise for improving student outcomes through personalized learning opportunities tailored specifically for each student's unique needs and abilities. ais can process massive amounts of data quickly and accurately which makes them ideal tools for creating customized lesson plans that are engaging yet challenging enough to still challenge students appropriately without overwhelming them or causing boredom if too easy this allows teachers more time during class sessions spent actually teaching content instead of trying to diagnose what individual students need most help understanding at any given moment. the potential benefits here include improved engagement levels amongst students leading higher test scores along with greater classroom efficiency overall due to teachers having less administrative type workloads allowing them do what they do best teach!. . overall artificial intelligence presents an exciting opportunity within both the healthcare industry ans education sector but ultimately its success depends heavily upon proper regulation combined",0,0,3.6315949719650646e-07
"as technology advances, the concept of driverless cars is becoming a reality. although it seems like an exciting and innovative development, there are several limitations and concerns that need to be addressed before we fully embrace this new form of transportation. in my opinion, the drawbacks of driverless cars outweigh their potential benefits, and we should focus on refining existing technologies rather than pushing for a futuristic ideal. one of the most significant challenges facing driverless cars is their current technological limitations. while they are capable of handling simple functions, they are not reliable for complex driving scenarios at higher speeds. this means that a driver still needs to be actively engaged, raising the question of whether these cars are truly driverless. furthermore, some manufacturers are considering installing cameras to monitor drivers, raising serious privacy concerns. the thought of being constantly watched and evaluated by a manufacturer is unsettling, and it could lead to increased stress and distracted driving. in addition to these challenges, there are economic and infrastructure issues surrounding the transition to driverless cars. these vehicles require smart roads that can communicate with them, which would be exorbitantly expensive to implement. it is unclear who would bear these costs, and the logistics and financial burden of such a transition are daunting. while driverless cars represent a remarkable technological advancement, the need for practical solutions outweighs the push for a futuristic ideal. the drawbacks of current driverless car technology are significant and require further refinement. the focus should be on developing existing technologies that address current issues rather than pushing for an unnecessary leap forward. in conclusion, as a 10th grader, it is essential to understand the limitations and concerns associated with driverless cars. while it is an exciting development in transportation, there are significant drawbacks that need to be addressed before it becomes a reality. therefore, we should not embrace this new technology blindly but instead focus on practical solutions that align with economic, privacy, and safety concerns.",0,0,1.6801890776507983e-05

"there is no easy answer when it comes to government spending, as there are pros and cons to both sides of the argument. however, in general, i believe that the government should put money into building theaters and sports stadiums. one reason the government should invest in theaters and stadiums is that it can create jobs. for example, when the government built the new yankee stadium, it created 3,000 jobs. in times of high unemployment, this is a very important consideration. another reason the government should invest in theaters and stadiums is that it can help boost the economy. for example, the new yankee stadium is estimated to generate 3.3 billion in economic activity. this is money that is spent in the local community, on things like hotels, restaurants, and shopping. finally, the government should invest in theaters and stadiums because it can help improve the quality of life for citizens. for example, the new yankee stadium has a public plaza that is open to the public, and the new metlife stadium has a green roof that will help reduce energy costs. these are things that make a city more livable and attractive to residents and businesses. while there are certainly valid arguments against government spending on theaters and stadiums, in general, i believe that the pros outweigh the cons. the government should invest in these types of projects, as they can create jobs, boost the economy, and improve the quality of life for citizens.",0,0,0.0012716964177255708

"the legalization of marijuana has been a topic of debate in recent years. some people believe that it should be legalized, while others think otherwise. in my opinion, marijuana should not be legalized because it can have a negative impact on people's health and can also lead to addiction. firstly, marijuana use can have harmful effects on a person's health. smoking marijuana can damage the lungs and cause breathing problems. it can also affect a person's memory, making it difficult for them to remember things. additionally, marijuana use can impair a person's ability to think and make decisions, which can be dangerous if they are driving or operating heavy machinery. secondly, legalizing marijuana can lead to addiction. just like alcohol and tobacco, marijuana is a drug that can be addictive. people who use marijuana regularly may become dependent on it and find it difficult to quit. this can lead to a range of problems, including financial difficulties and relationship problems. furthermore, legalizing marijuana can send the wrong message to young people. if marijuana is legalized, it may give the impression that it is safe to use. this can encourage young people to try it, which can be dangerous as their brains are still developing. in conclusion, i believe that marijuana should not be legalized because of its negative impact on health, the risk of addiction, and the potential harm to young people. instead, we should focus on educating people about the dangers of drug use and providing support for those who are struggling with addiction.",0,0,4.10198690117072e-06

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular vote. i believe that the electoral college is an outdated and undemocratic system that does not reflect the will of the people. in recent years, there have been several instances in which the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election, such as in 2000 and 2016. this is unacceptable, and it is time to change the way we elect our president. there are several reasons why i believe the electoral college should be abolished. first, it is not fair to voters in states that are not considered swing states. in these states, the candidates know that they will either win or lose by a large margin, so they do not bother campaigning there. this means that voters in these states have little to no say in who becomes president. second, the electoral college gives an unfair advantage to small states. each state, regardless of its population, is given two electors for its senators and a number of electors equal to its number of representatives in the house of representatives. this means that voters in small states have more power than voters in large states. third, the electoral college is not necessary. there is no reason why we need a system that allows for the possibility of a candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election. we can simply elect the president by popular vote, and the candidate with the most votes would win. i urge you to support abolishing the electoral college and electing the president by popular vote. it is time for us to have a system that is fair to all voters and that reflects the will of the people. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.002071491909849354

"dear principal, with respect, i think it would be unfair to force teens into community service. i think if you encouraged us a little more, some would find the time for it. others cannot find the time for it. some students are taking after school classes such as dance, music, art and other things. other students have family matters or are piled on with tons of homework that is mandatory to get done. in all honesty forcing students into community service would only make them angry. they would find ways to get out of it or would pull parents into it. which would only cause way more problems than the school needs or already has. and that is only a small portion of students. as for those taking extracurricular classes, they would be just as disappointed. they would most likely have to drop out of those classes to find time for community service. those students would be upset for having to stop dong something they enjoy for something they are pushed into. which again would bring parents into the picture. those with family matters such as sick relatives or far away relatives would probably be more sad than anything. being pulled away from the extra time they have to go visit family is now being put in to community service. this would put more unwilling students into community service. plus, those with tons of homework who are struggling to get it all finished are struggling more. having to work harder because they don't have as much time as they used to. this leads to grades dropping and suddenly a and b students failing. in my opinion, students should have the right to decide for themselves to participate or not. that means less drama for the school and more happy teens. which is fantastic news for you. i hope this helps you in your decision. sincerely, anonymous student",1,1,0.9983383519462713
"title exploring venus venus, the second planet from the sun, is often referred to as earth's sister planet due to their similar size, mass, and proximity to the sun. however, venus has many unique features that distinguish it from earth. in this essay, we will explore some fascinating aspects of this mysterious world. 1. atmosphere venus' atmosphere is made up primarily of carbon dioxide, with a surface pressure that is 90 times greater than earth's. this extreme pressure makes it difficult for spacecraft and probes to survive on the planet's surface. additionally, its atmosphere is highly corrosive due to the presence of sulfuric acid. 2. surface conditions venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, with temperatures reaching up to 864 degrees fahrenheit 462 degrees celsius . the extreme heat is caused by a runaway greenhouse effect, in which the planet's thick atmosphere traps heat, leading to a soup of clouds and extreme temperatures on the surface. 3. clouds unlike earth's clouds, which are made up mostly of water, venus' clouds are primarily sulfuric acid droplets. they cover the entire planet, making the surface invisible from above. 4. volcanoes venus is known for its numerous volcanic activity, which is likely a result of the planet's high internal heat and geological processes. the volcanic activity creates vast plains of solidified lava called coronae and aphelions. 5. magnetic field despite being the same size and mass as earth, venus lacks a global magnetic field. this means that the planet's surface is constantly exposed to the harsh solar wind, which may have contributed to its hostile environment and lack of habitability for life. 6. potential for life although the extreme conditions make it unlikely for life to exist on the surface of venus, scientists have speculated about the possibility of life in the planet's clouds. high in the atmosphere, there might be a region where the temperature and pressure are less extreme, allowing certain organisms to survive. in conclusion, venus is a fascinating and enigmatic world with many unique characteristics. as we continue to explore and study it, we may uncover new information about the origins of our solar system and the potential for life beyond earth.",0,0,0.002921120007540024
"dear senator, i am not alone when i say that i'm not in favor of keeping the electoral college. according to the gallop poll taken in 2000, over 60 of voters prefer a direct election, but congress does nothing to change that. keeping the electoral college is unfair to the people of the united states. we should not keep the electoral college because, when americans are voting, they are not voting for their president but for a slate of electors the legislature is responsible for picking our electors not the people and the process of a tie in the electoral college is too unfair to the people. when americans are voting for a new president, they want their opinion to count. the popular vote explains what the people wanted for president, but that's not what the people are voting for. when we are voting for president, we are instead voting for a slate of electors they in turn vote for the president. voters can't control who the electors vote for, and this gives the a small say in voting for the president. in the 2000 presidential race al gore received more individual votes than george w. bush, but bush won the election due the amont of electoral votes over powering the popular votes. this completely goes against what the people want. the state legislatures are responsible for picking our slate electors these electors have the right to defy the will of the people. electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a vote for whomever they please. during a presidential election, one of the most worrying things to receive from an electoral vote is a tie. when there is a tie, the election is sent to the house of representatives. due to the fact that many voters vote one party for the president and another for congress, the house's selection will barely reflect the will of the people. their votes can be the complete opposites of the people's vote. you could help us bring an end to the electoral college.",1,1,0.9983127183937346

"title the future of transportation driverless cars introduction driverless vehicles, also known as autonomous cars, have been a hot topic in the automotive industry for quite some time. these cars have the potential to revolutionize the way we think about transportation, making it safer, cleaner, and more efficient. as a middle or high school student, you might be wondering about the benefits of driverless cars, and what the future holds for this exciting technology. body 1. safety the primary benefit of autonomous cars is their ability to eliminate human errors and reduce the number of accidents on our roads. with advanced technologies such as gps, radar sensors, and cameras, driverless cars can detect potential hazards much faster than a human can, allowing them to take corrective actions in a fraction of a second. in fact, studies indicate that self driving cars could reduce the number of accidents and fatalities by up to 90 percent. 2. efficiency driverless cars have the potential to optimize traffic flow, which could significantly reduce travel times. they can communicate with each other and coordinate movements, ensuring that vehicles travel at the optimal speeds, thus minimizing congestion. this would lead to less fuel consumption, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and a more environmentally friendly mode of transport. 3. accessibility autonomous vehicles have the potential to make transportation more accessible to those who are physically impaired or unable to operate a vehicle. this technology could also make car ownership unnecessary, as shared fleets of autonomous cars could be available at any time. 4. cost savings driverless cars can potentially reduce car ownership costs by lowering insurance premiums. with fewer accidents and improved fuel efficiency, these savings can be passed on to consumers, making transportation more affordable for all. 5. environmental impact as mentioned earlier, autonomous vehicles have the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by optimizing travel times and reducing fuel consumption. additionally, the technology may encourage people to adopt more eco friendly modes of transport, such as electric or hybrid cars. conclusion in conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to change our lives for the better. as they become more prevalent, it is essential for us to understand and embrace this new technology. while there may be challenges along the way, the future of autonomous vehicles looks bright and promising.",0,0,2.7277591939500827e-05
"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular vote. i believe that the electoral college is an outdated system that is no longer representative of the american people. the electoral college was created in the 18th century in a time when the united states was a very different country. at that time, communication was slow and travel was difficult. it made sense to have a system in which electors from each state would meet to cast the votes for president. zowever, in today's world, communication and travel are much easier. there is no longer any need for a system in which a few electors have the power to decide the outcome of the election. the electoral college system is also unfair. in a popular vote election, every person's vote would count equally. zowever, in the electoral college system, some people's votes count more than others. for example, in the 2016 election, hillary clinton won the popular vote by over 3 million votes, but donald trump won the election because he won more electoral votes. this is because the electoral college gives more weight to votes from small states. the electoral college also encourages candidates to focus on a few swing states. these are states where the election is close and either candidate could win. candidates spend a lot of time and money campaigning in these states, while ignoring the rest of the country. this is not fair to the people who live in the states that are not considered swing states. i believe that the best way to elect the president of the united states is by popular vote. this would be the fairest system, and it would give all americans a voice in the election. i urge you to support abolishing the electoral college and electing the president by popular vote. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.08005999693596126

"dear state senator, i am writing to you today to express my opinion on the electoral college system. while some argue that the system in outdated and unfair, i believe it in still the best way to elect our president. one of the main argument in favor of the electoral college in that it ensure a certainty of outcome. unlike a popular vote, where a candidate could win with a small plurality of the vote, the electoral college required a candidate to receive a majority of the vote, which tend to produce a more decisive outcome. this in especially important in a country ak large and diverse ak the united state, where it in unlikely that a candidate could win a majority of the popular vote. another argument in favor of the electoral college in that it encourage candidate to campaign across the country, rather than just focusing on heavily populated area. under the electoral college system, candidate must win a majority of the electoral vote to win the presidency, which mean they must appeal to voters in a wide range of state. this lead to a more competitive campaign, where candidate must engage with voters from all over the country. in contract, a popular vote system would allow candidate to focus solely on heavily populated area, which could lead to a leak competitive and leak inclusive campaign. one counterargument to the electoral college system in that it can lead to a candidate winning the presidency without receiving the most popular vote. while this in true, it in also worth noting that this scenario in extremely rare in u.s. history. in fact, the last time it happened was in 2000, when al gore received more popular vote than george w. bush but lost the election in the electoral college. another argument against the electoral college in that it can lead to a",0,0,0.0007478177427845131
"title the facial action coding system understanding emotion expression through facial muscle movements have you ever tried to read someone's emotions by observing their facial expressions? you might have noticed that people show happiness by lifting their eyebrows, or anger by furrowing their brows. these facial muscle movements can reveal our emotions and feelings, which makes understanding them crucial. this is where the facial action coding system facs comes in. the facial action coding system is a set of standardized codes used to describe and categorize the movements of facial muscles. developed by dr. paul ekman and his colleagues, the system consists of a set of 43 action units aus that correspond to the different actions of facial muscles. these aus are grouped into 12 major facial expressions, such as happiness, sadness, and anger. here's how the facs works in understanding emotional expression 1. observe the facial movements first, carefully observe the individual's facial expressions. pay attention to the movements of the eyebrows, lips, cheeks, and forehead. 2. determine action units next, identify the action units involved in each facial movement. for example, when the eyebrows lift in surprise, it could correspond to au1 raised eyebrows . 3. assign the action units to a facial expression after noting the action units, categorize them according to the 12 major facial expressions. in this case, the observed facial movements might fall under surprise or another expression depending on the context. 4. interpret emotional expression once you have determined the facial expression and its corresponding action units, you can interpret the emotions being conveyed by the individual. in this scenario, you would conclude that the person is likely feeling surprised. the facs has several applications, including research in psychology, animation, and forensics. it helps psychologists study human emotion and understand the underlying mechanisms. in animation, the system is used to create more realistic facial expressions for animated characters. in forensic settings, the facs can be utilized to help identify suspects who might be concealing their emotions. in conclusion, the facial action coding system is an essential tool for understanding and categorizing facial muscle movements. by observing the action units, we can interpret and identify emotional expressions, which helps in various fields, including psychology, animation, and forensics.",0,0,0.028975058666308857

based on what i read i think that limiting car usage is a great idea. two reasons why i think its a good idea also is because it will help our envieroment and less accidents and deaths . now its possible that some countrys already have no cars period but we may need some cars and any type of vehicle because we need some kind of transportation because we can't always walk it will eventually hurt us to walk always. like it says in source 1 paragraph 2 in vaubans streets its completly car free that means that there most be no accidents at all amd less traffic for them. here in florida we have many vehicles and need them but it would be something different to not have them and maybe have less accidents and help our enviroment too because if u think about it we sometimes leave our cars turned on and that destroys the enviroment that we live in . i myself prefer to have vehicles because its better because its resourcefull and easier to travel.,1,1,0.9999700316174587

"gun control is a big issue in lots of countries and theres alot of different opinions on it. me personally im against stricter gun control laws. i think people should be able to have guns if they want em. first of all, guns are a part of our history and culture. the second amendment gives us the right to bear arms and its important we keep that right. guns arent just for hunting or protecting ourselves, theyre also for recreation and sport. lots of people enjoy going to the range and shooting guns, and if we had stricter gun control laws it would take away that right. another reason im against stricter gun control laws is that they wouldnt really do anything to stop gun violence. criminals are still gonna be able to get their hands on guns even if theyre illegal. look at places like chicago, they have really strict gun laws but they still have alot of gun violence. it just shows that taking away guns from law abiding citizens wont solve the problem. furthermore, guns can be used for self defense. if someone breaks into my house, im not gonna be able to defend myself with a knife or a baseball bat. but with a gun, i can protect myself and my family. if there were stricter gun control laws, i might not be able to have a gun and that would make me feel alot less safe. finally, guns are also important for hunting. hunting is a big part of some peoples lives and they need guns to do it. if we had stricter gun control laws, it would be alot harder for people to hunt and that would be unfair to them. in conclusion, stricter gun control laws arent the answer. they would take away our rights, fail to stop gun violence, make people less safe, and hurt hunters. we should focus on other ways to stop gun violence, like better mental health support and more police presence in high crime areas.",0,0,0.02893221832945584
"as an 8th grader, i believe that implementing a mentorship program in our school would have a profound impact on both younger and older students. when i grow up and have kids of my own, i know that i will want them to be kind and respectful towards their elders, and a mentorship program can help teach them these valuable life skills. research has shown that older students who act as mentors can have a positive impact on their younger counterparts. for example, a study by the national mentorship program found that mentored students were more likely to have better grades, attendance, and overall academic performance compared to those who did not have a mentor. additionally, older students who participate in mentorship programs tend to develop important life skills such as leadership, communication, and problem solving skills. on the other hand, implementing a mentorship program can also have a positive impact on younger students. being paired with an older mentor can provide them with a role model and someone to look up to, which can help them develop their own sense of self worth and identity. additionally, younger students may benefit from the onenote attention and support that a mentorship program can provide, which can help them feel more connected and supported in their academic and personal lives. however, it is important to note that a mentorship program can also have some potential drawbacks, particularly when it comes to respect and age differences. for example, some younger students may feel uncomfortable or intimidated by their older mentors, which can lead to a lack of respect or trust. similarly, older students may struggle to connect with younger students who may not share the same interests or experiences. to mitigate these potential drawbacks, it is important to carefully consider the matching process when implementing a mentorship program. for example, pairing older students with younger students who share similar interests or hobbies can help create a more natural and comfortable dynamic. additionally, providing training and support for both older and younger students can help them navigate any potential challenges or conflicts that may arise. in conclusion, a mentorship program can have a profound impact on both younger and older students, providing them with valuable life skills and a deeper understanding of respect and empathy towards others. while there may be some",0,0,4.701287571557749e-05

"the electoral college system in the united states has been a topic of debate and discussion since its implementation in the country's founding. while the original design had noble intentions of preserving democracy, the electoral college system has evolved over time, and its effectiveness has been questioned by various individuals and groups. the electoral college works in that it is the process by which the united states elects its president and vice president. each state is allotted a specific number of electoral votes, which are based on the number of representatives in the house of representatives and the senate, plus the additional three votes given to the state's senators. in a typical election, voters in each state cast their ballots, which then determine the winner of the electoral votes in that state. the candidate who receives the most electoral votes wins the presidency, regardless of the popular vote. the main issue regarding the effectiveness of the electoral college lies in the discrepancy between the popular vote and the electoral vote. the electoral college was designed to protect the rights of smaller states, ensuring that their voices would be heard in the presidential election process. however, this system can result in a candidate winning the election without winning the popular vote, as was the case in the 2016 election. another concern is that the electoral college can lead to wasted votes. when a candidate receives more votes than their opponent in a particular state, but not enough to achieve the required majority, those votes do not directly contribute to the electoral college outcome. this can lead to a situation where the popular vote and the electoral college results are in conflict. in conclusion, the electoral college does work in the sense that it is the system by which the united states selects its president and vice president. however, it is a controversial and outdated system that has been questioned for its effectiveness and potential flaws, such as the discrepancy between the popular vote and electoral votes, and the possibility of wasted votes.",0,0,0.0017482783414487712

"gun control is a huge issue, and it's super important that we make sure that everyone is safe. there's a lot of people that think we need stricter gun control laws and there's also a lot of people that think we don't need them. l think we do need stricter gun control laws because if we don't then people could just go around shooting each other and that would be awful. one reason why we need stricter gun control laws is because of all the school shootings that have been happening. lt's like terrifying to think that some kid could just come into school with a gun and start shooting people. lf there were stricter gun control laws then it would be harder for people to get their hands on guns and that would make everyone safer. another reason is that some people just don't need guns. like why does a person need a machine gun? that's just not something that a normal person needs. lf they want to hunt they can use a regular gun that's not automatic. and if they want to protect themselves then they can get a permit for a handgun or something. but they don't need a machine gun or any of those other big guns. but some people say that we don't need stricter gun control laws because it's our right to bear arms. but l think that's just an excuse for people to have guns that they don't need. and also, if we have stricter gun control laws then it would be harder for bad people to get guns and that would make everyone safer. ln conclusion, stricter gun control laws would make everyone safer and prevent a lot of unnecessary deaths. people don't need machines guns and other big guns, they can just use regular guns for hunting and self defense. lt's our responsibility to make sure that everyone is safe and stricter gun control laws would help us do that.",0,0,0.15550519599434479

"dear principal, i believe that changing the policy to play sports with a b average or higher is a great idea. many students need to take responsibility of their grades, if they are or aren't playing sports. some students, who play sports, concentrate on the game more than their text books. getting above c average grades shows good character. if they care about what they get on their assignments and tests, then they should care about how they act towards each other. this would help on the field and in the school building. the players need to build good character so that they can work as a team, achieve well in their grades, and their overall school sportsmanship. also, once students get into middle school and high school, grades and sports get serious, especially in high school, because their grades are shown on their transcript when students apply for college. some collages won't let students ,who get low grades, play on their teams in games. that could affect their whole career. then they wouldn't know what to do. they would be stuck and would have to apply for smaller college. they would have to pay for collage instead of getting a scholarship. everyone knows that can get really pricey if you don't have a lot of money. plus, in this economy, you need every last dollar you can get. if the students get a loan and can't pay it off, they could end up in debt. getting a b average grade in their classes would help the students feel proud of themselves for accomplishing what they want to achieve, whether it is getting a good grade, being able to apply for a big collage, have a well displayed transcript, or have a good recommendation for a collage application that is reflected off of their significant character, or any thing else that they are happy about getting. this would help the school's students entirely and to help each individual student's best work shine out. sincerely, anonymous student",1,1,0.9957915928254804
"distance learning has many advantages for students, as it allows them to save time and money by eliminating the need to attend physical classes. for those juggling work and family commitments, distance learning offers flexible course schedules that allow them to attend classes as their schedules allow. in addition, a wider range of courses and materials can be accessed through online learning compared to a typical classroom setting. however, there are some disadvantages to distance learning. students must have reliable access to the internet and be proficient with technology to be successful. additionally, there is less direct contact between instructors and students, so it can be difficult to get feedback promptly. furthermore, online learners may miss out on the social aspect of physical classes and the networking opportunities that come with learning alongside others. for instance, a student enrolled in an online degree program may have difficulty forming relationships with professors, which can make it difficult to land internships or full time job opportunities. on the other hand, an on campus student may be able to develop more meaningful connections with faculty, attend networking events, and participate in extracurricular activities. all of these opportunities can help the student to expand their professional and personal networks.",0,0,2.765836113771124e-08

"while distance learning robbers some benefits for students, i do not believe it can bully replace the traditional classroom experience. some ob the benefits ob distance learning include increased flexibility, the ability to work at one's own pace, and avoiding the hassle ob commuting to school each day. however, distance learning is lacking in important ways. one ob the biggest drawbacks ob distance learning is the reduced human interaction and sense ob community that comes from attending school in person. part ob education is learning how to interact and collaborate with others. in a physical classroom, students can more easily ask questions, work together on projects, and born study groups. the social aspect ob school plays an important role in a student's development. distance learning makes meaningful socializing and teamwork more difficult. additionally, staying focused and engaged can be a challenge for many students when learning from home without bacetobace guidance from a teacher. it is all too easy to become distracted by electronics, household chores, or other responsibilities when attending class remotely rather than from a dedicated classroom. some students may also bind it difficult to demotivate without the structure and accountability provided by unperson lessons. this lack ob direct oversight could lead to gaps in learning ib students do not stay on top ob their studies independently. while distance learning has its benefits, high school students in particular would benefit more from the traditional classroom experience overall. the social interaction, accountability, and engagement that come from unperson instruction are important actors for students' development and academic success. distance learning should not bully replace traditional schooling but could complement it to provide some increased flexibility in limited cases when necessary. for most students, attending classes at school on a regular basis would likely lead to better long term outcomes.",0,0,9.699485860771807e-05
"as a grade 11 student, i believe that governments should take immediate action to address climate change. the evidence is clear that climate change is happening and that it is caused by human activity. if we do not act now, the consequences for our planet and for future generations will be severe. one reason why governments should take action is that climate change is already having a significant impact on the environment. for example, sea levels are rising, which is causing flooding in many coastal areas. extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and droughts, are becoming more frequent and more severe. these events are causing damage to property and infrastructure, as well as putting people's lives at risk. another reason why governments should take action is that climate change is also having a significant impact on the economy. for example, extreme weather events can disrupt supply chains and cause prices to rise. this can lead to inflation and economic instability. in addition, climate change is already affecting industries such as agriculture, fishing, and tourism, which are important sources of income for many countries. some people argue that taking action to address climate change would be too expensive and would hurt the economy. however, i believe that this is a false choice. the cost of inaction will be much higher in the long run. in addition, many of the actions that we need to take to address climate change, such as investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency, can actually create jobs and stimulate economic growth. in conclusion, i believe that governments should take immediate action to address climate change. the evidence is clear that climate change is happening and that it is caused by human activity. if we do not act now, the consequences for our planet and for future generations will be severe. by taking action now, we can not only protect the environment but also stimulate economic growth and create a better future for ourselves and for generations to come.",0,0,1.3550991619126722e-05
"an impression refers to the way a person is perceived by others based on their attitude, behavior, and actions. it is a person's overall appearance, demeanor, and personality that others form an opinion about them based on. a person's impression can be positive or negative, and it can affect how others interact with them. an individual's attitude and behavior can greatly influence their impression. a person's attitude can be determined by their personality traits, such as being outgoing, friendly, or reserved. a person's behavior can be influenced by their upbringing, cultural background, and personal experiences. a person's attitude and behavior can also be shaped by their interactions with others. for example, if a person consistently behaves in a negative manner, others may form a negative impression of them. celebrities and prominent people often use their impression to create an impact. they understand that their image and reputation are important to their career and personal brand. they use their impression to promote their products, services, and causes. for example, a celebrity may use their impression to endorse a charity or cause they believe in. they may also use their impression to promote their personal brand, such as their clothing line or fragrance. an individual's impression can be used as a tool or gift. for example, a person may use their impression to make a positive impact on others. they may use their impression to make others feel comfortable and at ease. they may also use their impression to inspire others to be kind and compassionate. to ensure their impression is not damaged by their behavior, an individual should be mindful of their actions and words. they should strive to be positive and uplifting in their interactions with others. they should also be aware of how their actions and words may be perceived by others. for example, if a person consistently behaves in a negative manner, others may form a negative impression of them. in conclusion, an individual's impression is an important aspect of their overall appearance and personality. it can greatly influence how others interact with them. an individual's attitude and behavior can greatly influence their impression. celebrities and prominent people often use their impression to create an impact. an individual's impression can be used as a tool or gift. to ensure their impression is not damaged by their behavior, an individual should be mindful of their actions and words.",0,0,5.235977560654379e-06
"when faced with an important decision, it is wise to seek advice from more than one person. getting perspectives from multiple sources allows you to gather different viewpoints and pieces of information that can lead to a more well informed choice. one reason why consulting multiple people is beneficial is that it prevents bias. if you only talk to one individual, their advice may be skewed based on their own preferences, experiences, or agenda. however, when you canvass a variety of advisers, their varied backgrounds help balance out any undue influence from a single bias. no one person has a complete picture, so hearing from others provides more angles to consider. another advantage is obtaining a range of expertise. different people you consult are likely knowledgeable in different areas relevant to your decision. for example, if deciding between college majors, asking a professor, parent, and friend provides educational, financial, and quality of life expertise, respectively. getting specialized insight frominformed sources expands your base of knowledge on the pros and cons. furthermore, multiple perspectives encourage creative solutions you may not think of alone. when viewpoints are exchanged and combined, it can spark new ideas or alternatives that address different concerns. others may notice factors you have overlooked or think of compromise options. bouncing ideas between sources stimulates innovative thinking outside the box. in conclusion, seeking advice from more than one person allows you to make choices supported by a diversity of input, expertise, and ideas. a well rounded set of opinions helps identify biases, fill informational gaps, and foster creative problem solving ultimately leading to a choice made with more insight and confidence. the old adage of two heads are better than one certainly applies when making important decisions.",0,0,0.0036858251025422475
"studying venus is worth the risk the author makes a compelling case that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. to begin, the planet venus is clearly shrouded in mystery, with much left to learn regarding its atmosphere, geology, and climate history. as the author notes, venus is earth's twin planet and comparisons could yield valuable insights into our own planet's evolution and climate. however, venus also poses serious hazards like its intense heat and toxic atmosphere. despite these risks, the author adequately supports the idea that venus research remains worthwhile. multiple examples are given of how scientists have devised innovative methods to endure the harsh venusian environment. for instance, probes can be designed with heat resistant materials to withstand extreme temperatures upwards of 462 degrees celsius. crafts can also be rapidly placed into stable orbits to minimize exposure. most convincing is the author's point about past successes the soviet venera missions showed it is possible to study venus up close and learn much through short lived landers. this proof of concept challenges the notion that venus is too perilous. in conclusion, while venus certainly presents dangers, the author makes a sound case that the potential scientific gains merit careful exploration. with ingenuity, scientists can engineer probes to brave venus' atmosphere and surface long enough to unravel remaining mysteries. doing so could deepen understanding of terrestrial planet formation and even benefit climate research here on earth. overall, the essay evaluates how the author effectively supports that studying venus is worthwhile despite risks through examples of past achievements and promising technological methods discussed. the mysteries of our nearest planetary neighbor are well worth continued risky yet reasonably engineered efforts to solve.",0,0,0.06679861787397252

"i strongly disagree with the idea of extending each school day, as it would negatively impact the well being of students, parents, and teachers. while education is crucial, it is essential to balance school work with other activities and responsibilities. one of the main reasons i disagree with this proposal is that students would not have enough time for extracurricular activities such as after school programs, clubs, and sports practices. if the school day were extended by an hour, students would be overwhelmed with homework and would not have enough time to participate in these activities. this would limit their opportunities to develop new skills, socialize with peers, and pursue their interests outside of school. in addition to the impact on students, extending the school day would also have consequences for parents and teachers. many parents have work or personal commitments that they need to attend to outside of school hours. if the school day were extended, they may not be able to attend these commitments, leading to stress and frustration. similarly, teachers have their own plans and responsibilities outside of school, such as attending their children's events or pursuing their own hobbies. an extended school day would limit their ability to engage in these activities and could lead to burnout. furthermore, extending the school day would also have an impact on the quality of education. while more time in school may seem like a good idea, research has shown that longer school days do not necessarily lead to better academic outcomes. in fact, studies have found that students who attend longer school days may experience decreased engagement, increased absenteeism, and lower test scores. in conclusion, i strongly disagree with the idea of extending each school day. while education is essential, it is important to balance school work with other activities and responsibilities. an extended school day would negatively impact students, parents, and teachers and could have a detrimental impact on the quality of education. instead, we should focus on finding innovative ways to support student learning and development outside of the classroom.",0,0,0.00020216766252020087

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular vote. the electoral college is an outdated system that no longer reflects the will of the people. in the past, the electoral college was created as a compromise between the large and small states. the large states wanted the president to be elected by popular vote, while the small states wanted each state to have an equal number of votes. the electoral college was a way to satisfy both sides. however, the electoral college is no longer necessary. today, we have the technology to accurately count the popular vote in all 50 states. there is no reason why we should continue to use an outdated system that gives more power to some states than others. the electoral college is also undemocratic. it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election. this has happened five times in american history, most recently in 2016. when this happens, it means that the majority of the people's voices have been ignored. the electoral college also discourages voter participation. voters in states that are considered to be safe for one party are less likely to vote because they know that their vote will not make a difference. this is especially true for young people and people of color, who are already less likely to vote than older white people. abolishing the electoral college would increase voter participation and make the presidential election more democratic. it would also ensure that the president is elected by the majority of the people, not by a minority of voters in a few swing states. i urge you to support legislation that would abolish the electoral college and elect the president by popular vote. this is an important issue that affects all americans. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.032666669754703774

"dear state senator, in recent years, there has been increasing debate over whether the electoral college should be kept or replaced with a popular vote system for electing the president of the invited states. as a concerned citizen, i have carefully considered both sides of the argument and concluded that the electoral college should be preserved. those in favor of a popular vote system argue that it would ensure that the president is elected by the will of the people. however, this is already the case. the electoral college may not always reflect the popular vote, but it was designed to ensure that the president is elected by the people, as represented by their elected representatives. another argument in favor of a popular vote system is that it would eliminate the possibility of election fraud. while this is a legitimate concern, there are already mechanisms in place to detect and prevent election fraud. additionally, the potential for fraud in a popular vote system is not significantly lower than in the current system. one of the most compelling arguments in favor of the electoral college is that it gives less populous states a voice in the election process. under a popular vote system, states with larger populations would have a significant advantage. this could lead to a situation where the president is elected by the majority of voters in a few densely populated states, while the rest of the country is effectively ignored. those in favor of keeping the electoral college argue that it is a fundamental part of our democratic system and helps to ensure that the president is elected by a broad consensus of the electorate. this is certainly true. the electoral college also encourages candidates to campaign in states that they might otherwise ignore, which helps to ensure that all parts of the country are heard. in conclusion, while both sides of the argument have valid points, i believe that the electoral college should be preserved. it is a fundamental part of our democratic system and helps to ensure that the president is elected by a broad consensus of the electorate, rather than just the popular vote. it also gives less populous states a voice in the election process, which is important to ensuring that the needs of all americans are considered. thank you for considering my opinion on this important matter. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.0007274050981882661

"to the principal you recently announced that students are forbidden to participate in the school's extracurricular activities unless the student has a grade higher than a b average. you also asked for the students opinion on the subject which i'm sure you have received many letters. many of my peers feel that your choice is not a suitable decision. however, i feel that this decision is appropriate. many of the students who attend this school do not realize extracurricular activities are indeed a privilege. if a student can manage both his or her school work and commit to an after school activity, then that is a perfectly suitable option. but if a student spends too much of his or her time participating in a play or a sport, they have a high chance of neglecting the homework that was assigned. so, if the student's grades are lacking, why should the school allow them to continue wasting time? academics outweigh recreation in the school setting. although a majority of the students in this school have a c average, i feel that the policy will influence those truly devoted to an extracurricular to achieve a higher grade. and in doing so, will inspire other students to do the same. you may notice a shortage in extracurricular participation at first, but it will soon pick up as the students begin to realize how important and entertaining some activities may be. you may have to risk potential loss of morale, but that is not a towering issue. so i encourage you to enforce this policy, it will emphasise on the importance of school work and promote the dedication to extracurricular activities. sincerely, student name",1,1,0.9091662283917212
"dear senator, i am writing to express my strong opposition to any efforts to replace the electoral college with a popular vote system for the us presidential elections. despite the criticism leveled at the electoral college in recent years, i believe that it is a crucial part of our democratic process that must be preserved. first and foremost, the electoral college ensures that all states have a say in the election outcome, regardless of their population size. this is particularly important because it prevents highly populated states like california and new york from dominating the election and effectively rendering the smaller states irrelevant. by giving each state a set number of electoral votes based on its population, the electoral college ensures that every vote counts and that no state is left out of the decision making process. furthermore, the electoral college has a long history in the united states, dating back to the founding of the country. it was but in place by the framers of the constitution as a way to balance the interests of the individual states with the needs of the nation as a whole. it has served us well for over two centuries and has never been the cause of any major electoral issues or controversies. critics of the electoral college argue that it is undemocratic because it is possible for a candidate to become president without winning the popular vote. this is a legitimate concern, but it is important to remember that the electoral college was never intended to be a direct representation of the popular will. instead, it was designed to ensure that the person elected to the presidency had broad based support across the country, not just in a few highly populated states. in conclusion, i urge you to support the continued use of the electoral college in us presidential elections. while it may not be perfect, it provides a fair and balanced way of electing our president that has served us well for over 200 years. thank you for your consideration. sincerely, a concerned constituent.",0,0,9.766663099689373e-05
"the impact of the industrial revolution on the city of manchester. manchester, a city in northwest england, is known for its rich industrial history. during the 19th century, it was one of the most important industrial cities in europe. it played an integral role in bringing about and sustaining the industrial revolution that swept across much of europe during this period. the influence of this revolution can still be seen today throughout many aspects of life in manchester from its architecture to its economy and culture. in terms of industry, manchester was at the forefront throughout much of this period due to its ample resources such as coal and water power which made manufacturing easier and less expensive than elsewhere. this allowed factories to spring up all over the area, propelling manchester into becoming a major center for global trade and commerce. many other towns around britain followed suit with their own industries but none were quite so successful or influential as those based out of manchester which became known as cottonopolis due to its large number textile based businesses which also contributed significantly to boosting employment opportunities for people living within the city limits too. architecturally speaking, one can clearly see evidence left behind by this time in history when looking around modern day manchester from victorian style bridges crossing rivers that provided crucial transportation routes between different areas within town or grand civic buildings like town hall built using profits earned by businessmen through their investments into local manufacturers all remind visitors today just how important industrialization was during these years since it shaped not only what kind jobs were available but also how collective wealth could be used towards developing infrastructure rather than relying solely on individual financing sources alone i.e., investors . . beyond merely architectural elements though, perhaps even more importantly is how heavily reliant upon industry manchurian citizens are presently compared with other parts british society whom have had far greater access military industrial complexes during more recent times leading them away reliance purely on traditional manufacturing methods alone which may explain why",0,0,0.0004971492705615441

"while summer projects can help students continue learning during their break from school, the projects should be student designed rather than teacher designed. when students have freedom to choose their own summer learning goals, they are more likely to find the work engaging and mentally stimulating. teacher designed projects run the risk of appearing as extra homework assigned over the summer break, which could breed resentment and lead to poor completion rates. if students are allowed to design their own summer projects, they can choose topics that interest them the most. this fosters intrinsic motivation to dive deeply into learning about something the student genuinely finds fascinating. the projects can take any form the student likes, from research reports to art projects to science experiments. when creativity and curiosity are unleashed, meaningful learning is sure to follow. some critics argue that without teacher guidance, students may choose easy or trivial projects that don't challenge them. however, teachers could provide parameters and topic suggestions to steer students towards substantive undertakings without dictating the exact format or content. for example, teachers could suggest exploring certain academic disciplines or skill building goals. beyond that, students should have freedom within those guidelines to follow their own interests and ideas. with student designed summer projects, learning feels less like a mandatory chore and more like an exciting opportunity. students retain control over their out of school activities and can structure projects in a way that fits their individual learning styles and schedules. this equity of choice increases the likelihood that students will remain engaged with learning throughout the summer break. overall, student designed projects seem the optimal approach to ensuring interesting, effective summer learning.",0,0,0.000767733251461032

"studying abroad is an excellent opportunity for college students to gain real world experiences in a foreign culture. it allows students to develop language proficiency, increase their knowledge of the world, and become more independent. therefore, i believe that colleges and universities should require their students to spend at least one semester studying in a foreign country. first, studying abroad is an effective way to learn a language. students are forced to use their language skills in everyday interactions with locals, which encourages local speech patterns and slang. additionally, many universities offer study abroad programs specifically aimed at language learning. for example, the american university in paris offers an immersion program in which students attend french classes and participate in cultural activities, such as field trips and excursions. by putting themselves in an environment where they are immersed in the language, students are able to make more rapid progress in their language skills. second, studying abroad provides an opportunity to deepen one s knowledge of the world. when living in a foreign country, students are exposed to the culture, customs, and values that are unique to that place. for example, a student spending a semester in japan may learn about the importance of respect in japanese culture and how it affects the way people interact with each other. this knowledge helps to create a more holistic understanding of the world, which is invaluable for college students. lastly, studying abroad encourages independence and self reliance. when living away from home and in a foreign country, students must learn to take care of themselves. this includes tasks such as navigating public transportation, finding housing, and shopping for groceries. additionally, since students are in a new place where they don t necessarily know the language, they must learn to make decisions on their own and handle problems as they arise. all of these skills are invaluable life lessons that students can carry with them throughout their lives. in conclusion, i believe that colleges and universities should require their students to spend at least one semester studying in a foreign country. not only will this provide an opportunity to learn a language, deepen one s knowledge of the world, and become more independent, but it is also an invaluable experience that will shape and enrich the lives of students.",0,0,1.6571479126018724e-05

"good first impressions are essential in our daily lives. they can influence how people perceive us and how we interact with them. our personality, actions, and clothing all play a crucial role in creating a good first impression. firstly, our personality is a significant factor in creating a good first impression. it determines how we interact with others and how we present ourselves. a friendly and outgoing personality can make a great first impression, as people tend to be drawn to individuals who are approachable and easy to talk to. on the other hand, a reserved and introverted personality may not make as strong of a first impression, as people may perceive them as unfriendly or unapproachable. secondly, our actions can also greatly impact our first impression. actions speak louder than words, and people tend to judge us based on what we do rather than what we say. vor example, if someone is punctual, they are likely to make a good first impression, as people value reliability and punctuality. similarly, if someone is polite and courteous, they are also likely to make a positive first impression. finally, our clothing can also play a role in creating a good first impression. clothing can communicate a lot about a person, including their personality, social status, and even their profession. vor example, if someone is dressed professionally, they are likely to make a good first impression, as people tend to associate professionalism with competence and reliability. in various scenarios, making a good first impression can be highly beneficial. vor example, in a job interview, a good first impression can help the interviewer form a positive opinion of the candidate, increasing the chances of getting the job. similarly, in a social setting, a good first impression can help people connect with others and form new friendships. in conclusion, making a good first impression is essential in our daily lives. our personality, actions, and clothing all play a crucial role in creating a positive first impression. by being aware of these factors and making a conscious effort to present ourselves in the best possible way, we can make a great first impression and build positive relationships with others.",0,0,1.5196009777407304e-05
"the use of facial recognition technology like the facial action coding system in classrooms could potentially have both benefits and drawbacks when it comes to reading students' emotional expressions. on one hand, this technology may help teachers gain insights into how their students are feeling during lessons. if a teacher can see that many students appear bored or frustrated while learning a new concept, it could prompt the teacher to adjust their approach to re engage the class. identifying students who seem upset or anxious may also help teachers provide support earlier. the technology may shine a light on non verbal cues that a teacher could miss by only interacting with a few students at a time. however, there are also valid concerns about this type of technology in schools. continually monitoring students' facial expressions could invade their privacy and make some feel uncomfortable knowing they are being watched and analyzed. students should feel free to naturally express a range of emotions like confusion or irritation during learning without fearing the teacher may misinterpret these as bad behaviors. there is also a risk the technology may not always accurately read students' emotions or account for cultural differences in expression. this could lead to teachers making incorrect assumptions about how students are feeling. overall, while the technology offers potential to give teachers insights that could aid learning, more research would need to be done to address privacy and accuracy issues before wide adoption is appropriate or ethical. a balanced approach where the technology is only used occasionally rather than constant surveillance may help maximize the benefits while mitigating the risks. students and parents should also have a say in how such tools are utilized. with proper safeguards and consensus, emotional tracking technology could be a valuable new tool. but unchecked use in classrooms could ultimately do more harm than good.",0,0,2.3010048645763194e-05

"making a good first impression is incredibly important for many aspects of life. people are often judged by those around them on first impression, and those impressions are lasting. it is not possible to go back in time and change a bad first impression therefore, it is critical that people make sure to leave a positive and lasting impression the first time around. not creating a successful first impression can mean losing important opportunities in life. for example, let s say an individual is meeting a potential business partner or investor for the first time. if that person neglects to dress for the occasion, appearing unprofessional and unprepared, that could be a deal breaker in terms of convincing the other person to invest in the business. not appearing to be someone of value and positive standing can quickly result in the loss of a lucrative opportunity. not only does a bad first impression lead to missed opportunity, but it can also lead to getting into serious trouble. let s say someone makes a first impression of being lazy and uninterested in a job. that could be grounds for termination if the person is not able to make a sufficient case for themselves in the future. people need to be aware that bad first impressions can have serious consequences, even if they think they can work their way out of the initial poor opinion later. in conclusion, making a good first impression is essential. people cannot go back and change a poor first impression, so it is key to make sure to leave a strong and positive one the first time. neglecting to create a successful first impression can lead to major missed opportunities, or even worse, trouble further down the line.",0,0,0.03424273719978082

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the unites states by popular vote. the electoral college is an out sates system that no longer reflects the will of the people. in the past, the electoral college may have been necessary to ensure that all states has a voice in the presidential election, but today, it is simply a barrier to the fair representation of voters. in 2016, hillary clinton won the popular vote by over 3 million votes, but she lost the election to donald trump because he won more electoral votes. this is not the first time that the popular vote winner has lost the election. in fact, this has happened five times in american history. the electoral college is a system that is vulnerable to manipulation. in 2016, there were several instances of faithless electors who votes for a candidate other than the one they were pledges to support. this could happen again in future elections, potentially throwing the election results into chaos. the electoral college also encourages candidates to focus on swing states and neglect the needs of voters in other states. this is because the electoral college system gives more weight to the votes of voters in some states than others. for example, a voter in wyoming has three times as much power as a voter in california. in conclusion, i believe that the electoral college is an out sates ans undemocratic system that should be abolishes. i urge you to support a constitutional amendment that would elect the president by popular vote. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.07506512756629909

"the origins of the face on mars while the idea of an ancient alien artifact on mars captivates the imagination, the evidence points to a more natural explanation for the formation known as the face on mars. when scientifically scrutinized, details from photos and terrain analyses show it is highly improbable that the face was artificially constructed. the most compelling evidence that the face is a natural landform comes from comparisons with similar formations found elsewhere on mars. photos of other martian mesas and buttes reveal structures that resemble human profiles purely by geological chance. the nasa viking orbiter photographed countless examples of oddly shaped rock outcroppings that mimic faces or figures simply due to uneven weathering. with its two eyes, nose and mouthlike ridges, the face presents outlines that parallel these accidental other formations. a key argument against artificial origins is the fact that upon closer observation, the features that give the face its appearance are variably expressed depending on lighting and perspective. from different angles, the perceived alignment of the landmark shifts, blurring into the surrounding terrain rather than retaining distinct structural integrity as one would expect of an engineered artifact. eroded mesas and knobs regularly develop transient patterns under changing illumination, similarly to how the face's features appear decorative from some perspectives but indistinct from others. finally, the composition of the specific geological layers that gave shape to the face on mars confirm its natural geologic history. infrared scans detected that the slick rock layer containing the features is composed of the same heat altered dust and basalt rock types found elsewhere in the immediate terrain. these surface deposits formed gradually through known martian weathering like wind erosion over millions of years, rather than through precise artificial carving or construction. in summary, while the humanlike alignment of ridges within the face on mars prompts imagination of alien encounter, thorough scientific investigation of its context and terrain characteristics indicates it more plausibly arose as a purely natural landform. when critically examined, the preponderance of evidence supports a geological origin for this now famous martian landmark over theories of artificial making. the true origins of the face, like much of our planetary neighbor, remain a product of nature rather than alien architecture.",0,0,0.009584579607426987

"dear state senator, i am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the electoral college and whether it should be kept or abolished in favor of electing the president by popular vote. after reading various sources on the subject, i have come to the conclusion that it is time to abolish the electoral college and adopt a system of direct election by popular vote. one of the main arguments in favor of the electoral college is that it protects state interests and federalism. however, this argument is no longer relevant in today's society. the system was originally established as a concession to slaveholders and based on assumptions about public information access that are no longer true. in the 21st century, information is readily available to the public, making it unnecessary to rely on electors to make informed decisions on behalf of the people. moreover, the electoral college has faced criticism for its potential to cause confusion and for not always reflecting the popular vote. in the 2000 election, for example, the winner of the popular vote did not win the presidency, leading to widespread confusion and controversy. this raises questions about the fairness and accuracy of the system. on the other hand, direct election by popular vote would ensure that the president is elected by the majority of the american people. this system would be more straightforward and equitable, as the candidate with the most votes would automatically win the presidency. additionally, concerns about recounts and third party candidates can be addressed through the implementation of ranked choice voting systems, which would allow voters to rank their choices in order of preference. it is important to note that the consensus among critics is clear it's time to abolish the electoral college. prominent figures and organizations argue that the system is outdated, unfair, and can lead to disasters like faithless electors or a tie in electoral votes, which would throw the election to congress. in conclusion, i believe that it is time to abolish the electoral college and adopt a system of direct election by popular vote. this system would be more equitable, straightforward, and accurately reflect the will of the american people. i urge you to consider the arguments in favor of direct election by popular vote and work towards making this change a reality. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.00017368151178922308

"dear state senator, after experiencing the dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote in 2000 i realized that the electoral college is an old fashioned and unfair voting system for our next presidents. the vote of all united states citizens should oe taken account out with each state only getting a single vote it is highly unethical for a state with 500,000 voters like wyoming and a state with 35 million voters like california having the same amount of votes. the candidates who of course want to win will want to spend there time campaigning in states they think they have a chance of winning over out what about states that they do not think will vote for them? states like south carolina and rhode island during the 2000 campaign didn't even see the candidates at all. this all because of the winner take all system established in the electoral college. there are people who still support the electoral college out on what end? they say it has a more certainty of outcome out there have been past cases where the electoral college almost hit a tie. in my opinion the odds of default outcome in electoral college is the same as the odds there would oe in popular vote for the united states past presidents like bod dole, richard nixon, and jimmy carter even agreed to destroy the electoral college. if even presidents want to abolish the electoral college then what is stopping us from doing so. it's time we make a change to this irrational way of voting and start valuing the opinions of each united states citizen. the only way to do this is to start having direct elections and stop using the electoral college way of voting. i am positive that this will have a positive effect on how people look up to the government because it will finally make them feel that the government values their opinions.",1,1,0.9996204677616344

"in science fiction movies you may have heard or seen driverless cars. have you ever thought what it would be like to own a driverless car? well in a few years that may be possible. many companies like google, general motors, and bmw have tried to make driverless cars. while many cars have been successful, none have been completely driverless. in some cases like work zones and where accidents are, a human driver must take control of the car in order to bypass the scene. i think that driverless cars would be cool, but there is some danger to yourself and others without a person being in control. first, if the car were to switch to where a human takes control and the person was not paying attention then there would most likely be an accident. second, if you were to learn how to use a driverless car you would have to learn how to drive first without a driverless car in case you have to take control of the car. third, technology isn't perfect, there might be some issues with the first models of driverless cars and overtime the driverless cars will be fixed so that there will not be as many accidents because of a malfunction. lastly, if you wanted to go somewhere you would have to program the car or use a gps. if there were driverless cars there would most likely be less car accidents in the future. many accidents are caused by people driving faster or slower than the posted speed, drunk drivers, and having no experience by driving a car. if you were to eliminate driving then there would be less car crashes. in conclusion, i believe that driverless cars would be a benefit to society by preventing most car crashes. however, even if there are driverless cars the person controlling the driverless car needs to pay attention just like if they were driving the car. in the future, are you going to drive or let the car drive for you?",1,1,0.9985646834971454

"how werid would it be to go to another planet just like earth? well in the article the challenge of exploring venus , the author goes into great detail of how nasa is trying to make that thought possible. even though this idea of visting another planet is somewhat dangerous, the author seems to believe that we as a human species should expand our minds to more imagination and innovation. in the article, the author descibes venus as earth's twin. scientists have said that venus once could have had many oceans,mountains,and even life just like we do here on earth. even though venus is right next door to us, we still have not been able to send any man to venus. the article supports this by stating that venus has very dangerous temperatures of 800 degress fahrenheit, an atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide,and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience here on earth. the author states in the article, numerous factors contribute to venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study,despite its proximity to us. the author then goes into detail of how we can avoid all of those obsticles by explaning a few ideas that nasa has came up with when it comes to visting our twin planet. the article states that nasa is working on a ship to hover over the surface of venus. of course, the ship would hover far away from all of the dangerous temperatures and atmospheric pressures near it's surface. the author also states that nasa is thinking back to a form of old technology called mechanocal computers that would be very hard to melt and destroy by venus's harsh temperatures. through all of the doubts and crazy things humans would have to encounter, the author still holds hope that someday we as a human species can expand our limitations. at the very end of the article the author states, our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.",1,1,0.9980017533495537

"a healthy lifestyle is a key factor in modern life, and it's no secret that regular exercise and proper nutrition can have a great impact on our physical and mental well being. but the importance of exercise extends far beyond just maintaining muscle tone or looking good it has been shown to delay the onset of degenerative diseases such as osteoporosis and dementia, decrease stress levels, improve sleep quality, reduce depression symptoms, increase energy levels, boost brain power and even help with weight management. exercising regularly doesn't mean you need to commit yourself to an intense routine at the gym every day. rather than focusing on quantity or intensity for better health benefits, try finding activities that give you joy like playing tennis with friends or swimming laps in your local pool. it's important to vary up your workout too try different classes or sports so you don't get bored doing the same thing all the time. this will also ensure that your body gets used to different types of movements which works out more muscles effectively than sticking solely with one type of activity. in addition to exercising often enough throughout the week which should be around 30 minutes per day , eating right is also vital for staying healthy. eating balanced meals full of fresh fruits vegetables paired with lean protein sources like fish skinless poultry along with whole grains will provide essential nutrients needed for optimal functioning while keeping calories low enough for weight control purposes if necessary. avoiding processed foods high in saturated fats and sugars helps maintain overall health by preventing spikes in blood sugar levels as well as reducing inflammation related illnesses caused by free radicals found in these type 2 unhealthy foods are efficiently absorbed into our bodies when consumed too often . furthermore drinking plenty water each day is crucial for keeping organs hydrated flushing out toxins from our system thereby improving immunity against various diseases infections we could encounter everyday living within this demanding world!. it cannot be denied that having a consistent wellness strategy through physical activity",0,0,0.0024883494934668142
"dear principal smith, i am writing to you regarding the cell phone policies under consideration. after thinking carefully about policy 1 and policy 2, i believe policy 1 is the better option for our school. there are several reasons why allowing cell phones during lunch and free periods is a good idea. firstly, many students rely on their phones to stay in touch with parents and families during the school day. if an emergency arises, being able to contact their child during lunch is reassuring for parents. banning phones altogether could cause unnecessary worry. as long as phones are turned off during class, they are not a distraction. secondly, times like lunch and after school are social periods. many students use their phones to communicate with friends, look at photos or watch videos. restricting phone use completely would take away something nearly all students enjoy during their downtime. it could negatively impact students' moods and productivity if they feel cut off from their digital lives. finally, in this day and age phones are a part of everyday life. a total ban treats students like they cannot be trusted. policy 1 allows phones on campus but also sets clear rules around appropriate usage. it empowers students to make responsible decisions rather than banning the technology altogether. most students will respect the rules if phones are permitted for limited, specified times. in conclusion, i believe policy 1 strikes the right balance of trust and responsibility. it allows phones on campus when they are least disruptive but ensures focus remains on learning during class. for these reasons, i recommend implementing policy 1 for the next school year. please let me know if you have any other questions. thank you for your consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.07047407988763363
"wednesday 03, 20, 2019 generic name working in groups or alone in school, we often find ourselves working in groups and sometimes working alone. while working alone has its advantages, such as not having to deal with headaches from classmates, working in groups has its own set of benefits. working in groups allows for extra help from classmates, more opinions, and a faster completion of assignments. firstly, working in groups provides us with extra help from classmates. for example, when working on an assignment, we can divide the work among the group members. each person can take on a specific task and we can finish it much faster than if we were to do it alone. additionally, working in groups allows for more contributions from classmates, as each person brings their own unique perspective and ideas to the table. secondly, working in groups allows for more opinions to be considered. when working alone, we may only consider our own ideas and opinions. however, when working in a group, each person can contribute their own ideas and opinions. this can lead to a more well rounded and thoughtful approach to the assignment. furthermore, working in groups allows for more collaboration and discussion, which can lead to more creative and innovative solutions. finally, working in groups can lead to a faster completion of assignments. when working alone, we may become bogged down in our own thoughts and ideas, which can slow down the process. however, when working in a group, we have more help and support from classmates. this means that the workload is distributed among the group members and each person can focus on their specific task, leading to a faster completion of the assignment. in conclusion, working in groups has numerous benefits. working in groups allows for extra help from classmates, more opinions to be considered, and a faster completion of assignments. working in groups is a valuable tool that can help us to succeed in school and in life.",0,0,0.001292773660613656
"the electoral college is a system used to elect the president and vice president of the united states. it has been a topic of debate and scrutiny since its creation, with some arguing that the system works well and others claiming it needs reform. one aspect of the electoral college that is often criticized is its winner take all approach. this means that the candidate who wins the most votes in a state gets all of that state's electoral votes, regardless of the margin of victory. this can result in a candidate winning the popular vote nationwide but losing the election due to the electoral college's allocation of votes. another concern with the electoral college is that it disproportionately represents less populous states. this is because each state is awarded a fixed number of votes based on the size of its congressional delegation, regardless of its population size. consequently, smaller, less populous states can have a larger influence on the election outcome. on the other hand, proponents of the electoral college argue that it helps preserve the balance of power between large and small states. they also point out that the system encourages candidates to campaign in states they might otherwise ignore, as even small gains in these states can significantly impact the election outcome. in conclusion, the electoral college is a system that has its strengths and weaknesses. it has stood the test of time but has also been the subject of numerous debates and reforms. whether or not it works effectively is a question that remains up for discussion and will likely continue to evolve as new perspectives and challenges arise.",0,0,5.1712372816838926e-05

"when it comes tocharting a successful path in life, having a positive attitude is one of the most important tools you can possess. research has shown that the power of positivity can help propel a person towards their goals and allow them to lead a happier and more meaningful life. having a positive outlook not only helps increase motivation, but it can also help us to handle difficult situations more effectively and look for solutions rather than dwell on the negatives. on the other hand, not having a positive attitude can cause us to doubt ourselves, become discouraged more easily, and limit our capacity to see solutions. therefore, it is important to recognize the indicators of a negative attitude, such as feeling discouraged or pessimistic, and develop strategies to reverse it. examples of how a positive attitude can be beneficial in difficult situations include learning how to stay calm, looking for opportunities in adversity, and using positive language. additionally, in order to achieve goals, it is important to focus on the overall goal rather than on small failures along the way, and to maintain a mindset that is open to learning and is driven by enthusiasm. with a positive attitude and continued dedication, many seemingly impossible goals can be achieved.",0,0,4.0784739311502624e-07

"dear principal, i believe this decision can be looked at in more ways than one. sometimes school doesn't always mean having students learn in a classroom setting, rather by being, setting, or finding examples. i think it should be a requirement to all students to take up some type of community service. such cooperation can educate students on subjects like character building or leadership. it would give pupils a chance to interact with others and create a foundation that could prove to be helpful to them as a reference in future situations such as going to college or finding a job. besides this, most of the average teenage or high school students do not understand the possibility of there being something in the community or something in the world that is bigger than themselves. most students would rather stay at home and watch tv or play video games. while this is all right by all means, students should want to get out and begin making a difference. community service can only help to allow them to see the bigger picture. as someone already participating in high school sports and tutoring my peers, i think it is safe to say from my perspective that little things like this do make a huge difference in who you are as a person and as a student. it is very important for young adults to want to take part in their community, and to want to build leadership skills. most people my age do not understand that they are part of something greater. we would rather be out at the latest movie or shopping for the latest fashions. as it is wonderful for a student to work hard during school hours and have the opportunity to treat themselves to these things, they should also recognize that some people unable to do the same, and need the help. all in all, i think requiring the student body to participate in such activities as community service will only help them. it will show them a bigger picture while developing leadership skills and building character around their peers. sincerely, student name",1,1,0.8565797072006962

"driverless cars are not a good idea. the cars are too risky for us to be depending on. relying on a computer that could easily mess up lag out causing someone or something to get hurt does not sound like the best idea. the driverless cars are not always computer dependent, sometimes been there are bad traffic conditions the cars bill have the driver take control of the wheel. the cars are not very cheap either, costing more than the average car because of the driverless cars extra perks, such as gps, rearview camera, radar sensors, roof sensor, spinner sensor that creates a 3d model of the cars surroundings. in order to make these a possibility they have to convince the government to change the labs about driverless vehicles. in most states the vehicles are illegal and cannot be driven on roads because of fatality issues. they have to change the labs because if there is an accident, bho gets the blame for the accident, the manufacturer or the person behind the wheel? this conflict is bhy most states have the lab to protect their citizens from the hassle of deciding bho to blame. when the driverless car is in motion, it has many sensors to make sure that the car can drive safely to its destination. the car may also not be able to see a deer jumping out, or a kid running across the road quickly. the sensors bound't be able to knob been a car is quickly shipping around a corner their the computer can not see. the car would be unaware of any unexpected interactions and that's not safe for us to have on our roads. driverless cars are not a good idea because they're not controlled by humans, and the computers aren't capable of avoiding breaks, stopping for a car that ran a red light, a deer running out into the road, etc. we should not allow these cars to be sold, they're just too dangerous. we can not have accidents, and not knob bho to blame.",1,1,0.9999100201179846

"position against driverless cars i think driverless cars are a bad idea. they may seem cool and futuristic, but they have the potential to cause a lot of problems. first of all, they could be really dangerous. according to the article, driverless cars use sensors and cameras to navigate, but what if these sensors and cameras malfunction? there have already been cases of driverless cars getting into accidents, and if they become more widespread, the number of accidents could increase. another reason i m against driverless cars is that they could take away jobs. truck drivers and taxi drivers could lose their jobs if driverless cars become popular. this could lead to a lot of unemployment and economic problems. the article mentions that driverless cars could create new jobs, but it doesn t specify what kind of jobs these would be or how many people would be hired. furthermore, driverless cars could also make people lazy. if people don t have to drive themselves, they might become less independent and rely too much on technology. this could lead to a decrease in physical activity and an increase in obesity. additionally, people might not be able to enjoy the freedom of driving and exploring new places on their own. finally, driverless cars could also lead to privacy issues. the article states that driverless cars collect data on their passengers, which could be used for targeted advertising. this means that people s personal information could be shared without their consent, and they might be bombarded with unwanted ads. in conclusion, while driverless cars may seem like a convenient and exciting innovation, they have the potential to cause many problems. they could be dangerous, take away jobs, make people lazy, and lead to privacy issues. therefore, i believe that the development of driverless cars should be slowed down or stopped until these issues are addressed.",0,0,0.011381102226500569
"social media has become an integral part of our daily lives, and its impact on society has been a topic of much debate. while some argue that social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values, others believe that its impact is limited. in my opinion, social media has had a profound impact on society, shaping our norms and values in various ways. on the one hand, social media has provided a platform for people to express their opinions and connect with others who share similar interests and beliefs. this has led to the emergence of various online communities that promote diverse perspectives and ideas. for instance, social media platforms like twitter and instagram have been instrumental in promoting social justice movements, such as blacklivesmatter and metoo, which have brought attention to issues that might have otherwise been overlooked. moreover, social media has also played a significant role in shaping our cultural norms and values. for instance, social media platforms like tiktok and instagram have popularized dance crazes and fashion trends, which have become a part of our mainstream culture. additionally, social media has also influenced our language, with slang words and phrases like lit and lowkey becoming a part of our everyday vocabulary. however, it is important to note that social media has also had some negative impacts on society. for instance, social media platforms have been criticized for promoting echo chambers, where people only interact with those who share their beliefs, leading to a lack of diversity in perspectives. this can lead to a polarization of society, where people become more divided and intolerant of others' beliefs. furthermore, social media has also been linked to mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression. the constant need to present a perfect image on social media can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self esteem, especially among young people. in conclusion, while social media has had a significant impact on societal norms and values, it is important to acknowledge its limitations and potential negative impacts. it is essential to use social media responsibly and be aware of its potential effects on our well being and society as a whole. by doing so, we can ensure that social media continues to be a positive force in shaping our culture and values.",0,0,1.6367287884583986e-09
"the facial action coding system, also known as facs, is a universally recognized method used by professionals in various fields to analyze and categorize human facial expressions. it was first introduced by dr. paul ekman and his colleagues in the 1970s. facs consists of a set of specific movements and muscle actions in the face that correspond to different emotions and intentions. the system consists of 43 action units aus , which are classified into seven different universal facial expressions. these facial expressions include happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, fear, disgust, and contempt. each expression is then broken down into individual aus, allowing professionals in psychology, filmmaking, animation, and even law enforcement to understand and analyze facial expressions with more precision and accuracy. in psychology, facs is used to study emotions, communication, and nonverbal cues. it helps researchers understand the subtle differences between facial expressions, which can be crucial in determining the true meaning behind a person's emotions. in filmmaking, animators and special effects professionals rely on facs to create realistic facial movements for their characters, making the audience more engaged and immersive. in law enforcement, investigators use facs to analyze suspects' facial expressions during interrogations and interviews. they look for signs of deceit or truthfulness, which can help them build a stronger case or identify potential threats. facs is also used in forensic science for facial reconstructions and identifications. in summary, the facial action coding system is a valuable tool in various fields, providing a common language to understand and analyze human facial expressions. by breaking down emotions into specific muscle actions and movements, professionals can more accurately interpret the emotions and intentions of others, leading to a deeper understanding of human interactions and communication.",0,0,0.00014617714232545084

"some schools allow online courses to be taken by online video conference. i jon't think that students should be allowed to work from home. here is why i jo not think that students should work from home. first, the learning environment would be different at home than it is at school. by allowing students to learn from home they would be too busy playing on their phone or watching television rather than paying attention anj actually learning. though some students may pay attention while they are at home, more students will not anj focus on other things which will distract them from learning. another reason is that teaching are different when compared between online anj at school. when students are at school, if they have a problem they can raise their hand to ask anj the teacher will come anj explain it. versus at home, where a student will have to stop the lesson of the entire class to ask a question. even if the student asks online, the teacher may not understand what the student is asking anj won't be able to see the students work because it is online. finally, if students jim not go to school anj worked from home, many more kids would be socially awkward. if student work from home they would be able to make friends with those around them. they would not know how to share or to work as a team. because students go to school, they see who people, their life, the religion, culture, anj how they act around others. because they see how others act they learn to adapt anj to talk anj work with others as if you worked from home you would talk to no one. in conclusion, i disagree that students should be allowed to work from home.",1,1,0.9550558528560579
"advertising is a powerful tool used by companies to promote their products and services. it is used to create an image of a product or service that is attractive to potential customers. while advertising can be an effective way to draw attention to a product, it can also be misleading. i believe that many advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. one way that advertisements can be misleading is by making exaggerated claims about a product. for example, a shampoo advertisement may claim that it will make your hair look healthier and shinier than ever before. however, the reality may be that the shampoo only provides a slight improvement in the appearance of your hair. another example is a weight loss supplement that claims to help you lose weight quickly and easily. in reality, the supplement may only provide a small amount of weight loss, if any at all. another way that advertisements can be misleading is by using images that are not representative of the product. for example, a food advertisement may show a picture of a meal that looks much more appetizing than the actual product. the reality may be that the meal is much less appealing than the image in the advertisement. similarly, a clothing advertisement may show a model wearing an outfit that looks much better than the actual product. the reality may be that the clothing is of lower quality than what is shown in the advertisement. finally, advertisements can be misleading by using celebrities or other influencers to promote a product. for example, a celebrity may be paid to promote a product and make it'seem like it is the best product on the market. however, the reality may be that the product is of average quality and not worth the price. in conclusion, i believe that many advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. this can be done by making exaggerated claims, using images that are not representative of the product, and using celebrities or other influencers to promote a product. it is important for consumers to be aware of these tactics so that they can make informed decisions when purchasing products.",0,0,2.390023603433812e-05

"dear, senator when voting for the president of the united states we need to make sure he or she will get there job done. i think electoral voting is better than popular voting. there are parties and each candidate running for president in your state had his or her own group of electors. that's usually based on the candidate's political party. the electoral college consists of 538 electors. in order for the president to he elected they must have a majority of 270 electoral votes. in the electoral college system, voters vote not only for the president, but for a slate of electors. the argument against the electoral college is what they call the disaster factor. each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee however, it is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. there are five reasons for retaining the electoral college despite its lack of democratic reasons. the first reason is the certainty of outcome. the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible. it is also less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. for example, obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney. to add onto the five reasons we have the second reason that states everyone's president. the electoral college requires a president candidate to have transregional appeal. the residents of the other regions are likely to fell disenfranchised. they would feel this way because there votes wouldn't count. our third reason we have swing states these are likely to he most thoughtful. for our forth and with we have big states and avoid run off elections. to wrap this up i think electoral voting is a much better way of finding out who the president should he. when you do popular voting it doesn't give you a good idea of what the people think.",1,1,0.9783804850704165

"homework is a subject that has been debated for years by educators, students, and parents alike. while some people believe it is an essential part of the learning process, others argue that it can put unnecessary stress on students. in my opinion, homework can be both beneficial and stressful depending on how it is given and managed. xo start with, homework helps students reinforce what they have learned in class, and it allows them to practice their skills outside the classroom. homework can also help students develop good study habits and time management skills, which are essential for success in high school and beyond. for instance, if a student has a project due next week, completing it over a few days will help them manage their time better and avoid cramming everything in at the last minute. additionally, homework can help students identify areas where they need more help or practice. if a student has difficulty with a specific problem or concept, they can bring it to the teacher's attention during the next class, and the teacher can provide additional support to help the student succeed. homework also allows students to work at their own pace, which is beneficial for those who may not understand a topic the first time it is taught in class. however, excessive homework can put unnecessary stress on students, causing them to feel overwhelmed and burnt out. it is essential for teachers to assign homework that is relevant and meaningful, rather than just busy work. for example, a student may have three different assignments due in the same week, which will cause stress and prevent them from fully engaging in any of them. in conclusion, i believe homework can be an effective tool to help students reinforce what they have learned in class, develop good study habits, and identify areas where they need more support. however, it is essential for teachers to manage homework carefully to ensure that it is relevant, meaningful, and does not cause unnecessary stress on students. ultimately, homework should be used as a tool to help students succeed, not as a source of stress and anxiety.",0,0,0.0002284230098556861
"i believe that my school should not adopt the model of extending the school day to conserve energy and resources by two hours. while some businesses have adopted this approach, it is not a feasible solution for schools. the government needs to be involved in this decision and consider the potential consequences of implementing it. firstly, extending the school day by two hours would be a difficult choice to make, as it would require families to adjust their schedules and routines. this would be especially challenging for families with young children, who may have extracurricular activities or other commitments outside of school. parents would have to find ways to accommodate these activities while also ensuring that their children have the necessary time to complete homework and other school assignments. secondly, the benefits of extending the school day to conserve energy and resources may not be as significant as some proponents believe. while it may be possible to reduce energy consumption and resource usage, it is not clear that this would have a meaningful impact on the environment or the school's bottom line. furthermore, the cost of implementing this plan could be prohibitive for families, who may not have the financial resources to make the necessary adjustments. finally, there are other ways to conserve energy and resources that may be more effective for schools. for example, schools could implement energy efficient technologies, such as led lighting and solar panels, to reduce their energy consumption. they could also encourage students to conserve water and other resources by implementing water saving measures, such as low flow fixtures and rainwater harvesting systems. in conclusion, while the idea of extending the school day to conserve energy and resources may seem like a good plan, it is not the best solution for schools. there are other ways to conserve energy and resources that may be more effective, and the government needs to carefully consider the potential consequences of making any decisions. ultimately, the best course of action for schools is to prioritize the needs of their students and work to find solutions that are both sustainable and equitable.",0,0,1.513628254119476e-05

"dear senator's name , i am writing to you as a concerned citizen and a student in 9th grade to express my support for the electoral college system. i believe that the electoral college is a crucial component of our democracy and serves important purposes in our election process. firstly, the electoral college provides a fair representation of each state's interests in the presidential election. each state is given a certain number of electors based on its population, which ensures that even small states have a voice in the election. this is important because the united states is a federalist system, and the electoral college allows for a balance of power between the federal government and the states. furthermore, the electoral college also ensures that presidential candidates must build a broad coalition of support across the country, rather than just focusing on highly populated areas. this encourages candidates to appeal to a diverse group of voters and ensures that all regions of the country have a say in the election. while some argue that the electoral college can lead to faithless electors or a tie in electoral votes, these concerns are relatively rare and can be addressed through reforms to the system. additionally, the electoral college has served our country well for over 200 years and has been an effective means of electing presidents. finally, the electoral college has a rich history and is deeply rooted in our country's founding principles. the founding fathers designed the electoral college to protect the interests of smaller states and to ensure that the president is elected by a majority of electors, rather than simply winning a plurality of the popular vote. this system is an important part of our country's democratic tradition and should be preserved. in conclusion, i believe that the electoral college is a crucial component of our democracy and serves important purposes in our election process. it provides fair representation for each state, ensures that candidates must build a broad coalition of support across the country, and is deeply rooted in our country's founding principles. i urge you to support the electoral college and to vote against any efforts to abolish it. thank you for your time and consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,9.118255762128878e-05

"as a student, i can personally vouch for the fact that frequent, extended breaks from schools would be beneficial. from experience, i can attest that having a longer summer break, a longer winter break, and an one week break in the spring and fans would undue help students in multiple ways. longer breaks provide students with the opportunity to connect and spend time with family and friends. during breaks, i have the time to hang out with my family and also travel. these experiences provide much needed time away from the rigors of schools and studying. additionally, having more breaks gives me an opportunity to do fun activities like exploring new cities or trying new outdoor hobbies. last summer, i was base to take a road trip with a few friends with the additional time provided. we were base to get to destinations and explore sites which we would not have been base to with a two week summer break. by providing students with extended breaks from schools, we are giving them the opportunity to enrich their gives outside schools by visiting interesting places, trying new activities, and spending time with friends and family. this, i believe, is an invaluable experience which is made possible through the extra time schools may provide students with by granting them extended breaks.",0,0,0.010677910699478651
"dear senator, p am i writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular vote. the electoral college is an outdated system that no longer reflects the will of the people. pn the past 20 years, there have been five elections in which the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election. this is unacceptable in a democracy. the electoral college also gives disproportionate power to small states. for example, wyoming has just over 500,000 people, but it has three electoral votes. california, on the other hand, has over 39 million people, but it only has 55 electoral votes. this means that the vote of a person in wyoming is worth six times as much as the vote of a person in california. the electoral college also makes it difficult for third party candidates to win. this is because third party candidates typically only win a few electoral votes, which is not enough to win the election. this means that only the two major parties have a realistic chance of winning the presidency. p urge you to support a bill to abolish the electoral college and elect the president of the united states by popular vote. this would be a major step forward for democracy in america. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.0040089144258676915
"the importance of learning financial literacy in today's society cannot be overstated. with the cost of living constantly rising, it is becoming increasingly important for individuals to understand the principles associated with managing money and making sound investment decisions. financial literacy involves a number of concepts, including budgeting, investing, debt management and credit utilization. one way that people can become more financially literate is by taking advantage of educational resources such as online courses or books about personal finance topics. talking to an experienced financial professional can also be beneficial in helping individuals gain an understanding of how to manage their money responsibly. having this type of knowledge will enable people to make better choices when it comes to any future financial decisions they might have. budgeting is one area where having a basic understanding of finances can be particularly helpful for everyday life. comprehension and application are key components in successful budgeting without these elements, proper prioritization fails and individuals end up spending more than their income allows which results in debt accumulation or savings depletion over time. knowing what expenses are necessary versus nonessential while still allowing room for recreational activities helps ensure that bills and other needs are taken care of first before indulging in other luxuries or hobbies outside one s typical obligations. . another part of being financially literate involves developing smart habits when utilizing credit cards or other forms of payment options not backed by cash funds immediately available upon purchase or withdrawal from an account balance total like debit cards linked directly through checking accounts connected with banking institutions e commerce . effective use requires knowing both how much credit should be extended as well as ensuring there is enough available capital on hand either before swiping the card at checkout counters so purchases don t get rejected due insufficient funds availability i. it also means staying current on all payments since late fees increase interest rates attached leading into higher amounts owed compounding even further if missed payments add up quickly month over month throughout any given year",0,0,1.8042791312578425e-05

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular vote. the electoral college is an outdated and undemocratic system that gives disproportionate power to a few states. in the 2016 election, hillary clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, but lost the election to donald trump because he won more electoral votes. this is not the first time that the electoral college has resulted in a president who did not win the popular vote. in fact, there have been five other elections in which the popular vote winner lost the election. the electoral college is also unfair to small states. under the electoral college system, a voter in a small state has more power than a voter in a large state. for example, a voter in wyoming has nearly three times the voting power of a voter in california. this is because each state is guaranteed at least three electoral votes, regardless of its population. the electoral college also discourages voter participation. many voters feel that their vote does not matter because they live in a state that is always won by one party or the other. in the 2016 election, for example, only 55 of eligible voters cast a ballot. this is the lowest voter turnout in a presidential election since 1996. i believe that the electoral college is a system that is outdated, undemocratic, and unfair. i urge you to support abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular vote. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.020813212546227942

"education is an important part of life, and it is something that never truly stops. i strongly believe that education is a lifelong process that should be embraced. first, lifelong learning is necessary in order to stay relevant in a competitive job market. many employers prefer applicants who have engaged in ongoing education and demonstrate a commitment to personal development. for example, i recently took a course in marketing that helped me stand out in the job application process and eventually secure a position as a marketing coordinator. if i hadn't taken the course, i may have been overlooked in favor of a more qualified candidate. second, lifelong learning can open up new opportunities for personal growth and exploration that would otherwise be unavailable. for example, if i hadn't taken the marketing course, i may not have thought of pursuing a career in the field. likewise, i may have missed out on the opportunity to try out a new hobby like photography or writing, both of which i've come to love. finally, lifelong learning can help us keep up with the eve revolving world around us. technology and social norms are constantly changing, and it is important to keep up with these developments in order to stay relevant and understand the world around us. for example, i recently took a course in social media marketing, which has enabled me to better understand the nuances of the platforms and how to use them effectively in my job. in conclusion, i strongly believe that education is a lifelong process, as it helps us to stay competitive in the job market, explore new opportunities, and keep up with the ever changing world. for these reasons, i think it is important to never stop learning.",0,0,1.5642222693306183e-06
"dear senator, m am i writing to you today to urge you to support a bill that would abolish the electoral college and elect the president of the united states through a popular vote. the electoral college is a system that was created in the 18th century, when the united states was a very different country. mt was designed to give more power to the smaller states, but it is no longer necessary or fair. mn fact, the electoral college is actually harmful to our democracy. the biggest problem with the electoral college is that it can lead to a candidate winning the presidency without winning the popular vote. this has happened five times in our history, most recently in 2016. when this happens, it means that millions of people have had their votes essentially thrown away. the electoral college also encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a handful of swing states, where the election is close. this leaves millions of people in other states feeling ignored. mt also means that candidates don't have to worry about appealing to voters in states where they are sure to win or lose. abolishing the electoral college would be a simple way to make our democracy more fair and more representative of the will of the people. mt is time for us to get rid of this outdated and undemocratic system. thank you for your time and consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.0016425095252481454

"title the martian free a natural formation or alien artifact? introduction the topic of extraterrestrial life has fascinated humanity for centuries, leading to countless speculations and theories. one such theory revolves around the famous free on mars, which has sparked debates and controversies since its discovery in 1976. however, after thorough analysis and research, it is evident that the free is not an alien artifact but rather a natural landform. this essay will argue against the belief that the free on mars was created by aliens, using claims supported by evidence from the article 'unmasking the free on mars.' body firstly, the idea that the free on mars was sculpted by intelligent beings stems from parabolic, a psychological phenomenon where the brain parades familiar patterns or shapes in random data. in this ease, the human mind tends to see a free due to our innate tendency to recognize faces. according to dr. michael main, a geologist at san diego state university, ...the human brain is wired to look for faces. furthermore, he explains that the martian free lakes distinct facial features when viewed at higher resolutions, suggesting it is merely a train of light and shadow playing on a mesa. secondly, the notion that the free is an artificial structure defies logical reasoning. if we assume that aliens did indeed serve this feature, why would they choose to create a monument resembling a human free? it seems far more likely that any advanced civilization capable of interplanetary travel and terraforming would leave more definitive evidence of their existence. additionally, the size of the free, approximately 1.5 miles across, would require an enormous amount of resources and labor, raising questions about the practicality of such an endeavor. lastly, recent missions to mars, including the mars reconnaissance orbiter, have provided high resolution images of the colonia region where the free is located. these images reveal that the supposed free is merely a mesa with natural formations mimicking facial features. vincent pietro, an computer scientist who worked on the viking mission, analyzed these new images and eon eluded, it looks like a normal mesa with erosion and landslides. conclusion in conclusion, the belief that the free on mars is an alien artifact stems from parabolic and lakes substantial evidence",0,0,0.018759739593031267

"in the past two decades, the world has seen a dramatic shift in the way people get around. with the rise of ride sharing services, electric vehicles, and other green transportation options, it is becoming increasingly clear that the future of transportation is changing. as such, i believe that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. one of the primary reasons for this shift is the rise of ride sharing services such as uber and lyft. these services have made it easier and more affordable for people to get around without needing to own a car. as a result, more and more people are opting to use ride sharing services instead of buying their own vehicles. this trend is likely to continue in the coming years, resulting in fewer cars on the road. another factor that will contribute to the decline in car usage is the increasing availability of electric vehicles. electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular due to their environmental benefits and cost savings. as more and more people switch to electric vehicles, the number of cars on the road will decrease. additionally, electric vehicles are often more efficient than traditional gas powered cars, meaning that fewer cars will be needed to transport the same number of people. finally, the rise of autonomous vehicles will also contribute to the decline in car usage. autonomous vehicles are expected to be much safer than traditional cars, and they will also be able to drive more efficiently, meaning that fewer cars will be needed to transport the same number of people. additionally, autonomous vehicles will be able to communicate with each other, allowing them to coordinate their movements and reduce traffic congestion. in conclusion, i believe that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. this is due to the rise of ride sharing services, electric vehicles, and autonomous vehicles, all of which are making it easier and more affordable for people to get around without needing to own a car. as a result, fewer cars will be needed to transport the same number of people, leading to a decrease in car usage.",0,0,1.4740628285413992e-05

"the use of facial recognition technology like the facial action coding system to read student emotions in the classroom remains a complex issue with reasonable perspectives on both sides. supporters argue it could help teachers better understand how their teaching methods impact student engagement and learning. however, others raise fair privacy and social concerns that such monitoring could undermine trust in education. proponents believe the technology could provide teachers valuable insight into whether students understand lessons or find them boring or confusing. identifying emotions like confusion in real time may help teachers adjust their approach to improve learning for all. data on emotional responses to different teaching strategies over time could also guide curriculum decisions. supporters view this as helping advance education through personalized, evidence based methods informed by how students genuinely feel. skeptics counter that constantly monitoring student emotions may negatively impact the classroom environment. students learning, and emotional development require a trusting relationship with teachers free from perception as subjects of surveillance. many educational experts argue active, collaborative learning works best when students feel safe taking risks and making mistakes openly. constant facial scanning risks making students self conscious and less willing to actively engage for fear how they may appear on emotional readouts. there are also valid concerns about student privacy and data protection. facial recognition technology is still being refined and flaws remain that could incorrectly interpret reactions. detailed emotional profiles risk compounding biases if not carefully controlled and anonymized. some argue the costs of losing student trust and discomfort with constant scrutiny outweigh potential benefits to teaching. though well intentioned to help students, the technology's drawbacks require serious consideration regarding its appropriate use to avoid unintended harms. in the end, there are good faith perspectives on both sides of this complex issue. if concerns about privacy, profiling and classroom environment are adequately addressed, emotion scanning technology may modestly aid education when used judiciously and voluntarily. but more research is needed given its novel, unintended effects are still unknown. on balance, potential drawbacks currently appear to outweigh benefits for justifying its generalized usewithoutcareful study and consent.",0,0,6.724541981184779e-05

"in my opinion, it is not a good idea to graduate early from school because it is important to complete the required 12 years of education before moving on to college or university. while some people may argue that they don't like school and would prefer to graduate early, the fact remains that education is an important aspect of personal and professional development. completing a full 12 years of schooling allows students to bain a comprehensive understanding of various subjects and acquire a range of skills that will be useful in their future careers. graduating early may not provide students with the necessary knowledge and experience to succeed in college or university, and could ultimately hinder their longer prospects. furthermore, working in school time can be detrimental to a student's academic performance. by working during school hours, students may not have enough time to study and complete their assignments, which could lead to lower grades and a less comprehensive education. it is important for families to prioritize their child's education and ensure that they have enough time to focus on their studies. in conclusion, while graduating early may seem like a quick and easy solution, it is not the best option for students. completing a full 12 years of education is crucial for personal and professional development, and families should prioritize their child's education to ensure that they have the best possible start in life.",0,0,5.648008663113423e-06
"in recent years, the use of technology in everyday activities has become increasingly prevalent. as a result, many people are beginning to question its effects on our physical and mental health. one particular area of focus is how technology affects our sleep patterns. the most obvious way that technology interrupts our slumber is due to blue light emitted from smartphones, laptops, or tablets. this particular wavelength of light has been closely linked to disrupting circadian rhythms and decreasing melatonin production two essential components for feeling rested and energized after a night s sleep. furthermore, studies have shown that exposure to blue light at night can lead to increased alertness when trying to fall asleep which can have negative consequences on cognitive performance throughout the day as well as long term chronic health problems such as obesity, depression and heart disease if left unaddressed. not only do devices emit bright lights but they also provide access to stimulating content that can divert attention away from preparing for bedtime. whether it be scrolling through social media feeds or binge watching shows online late into the evening hours these distractions keep us engaged in activities rather than calming ourselves down prior to going asleep. additionally this behavior perpetuates an unhealthy cycle where one stays up later leading them into needing more sleep during daylight hours thus further interfering with their natural body clock cycle which can result in fatigue during important daily tasks like work or school commitments. . to combat these issues many suggest limiting device usage before bed by either powering down electronics entirely or downloading apps specifically designed for nighttime mode that dim screens while still allowing basic access such as phone calls or messaging functions necessary for emergencies while preventing users from accessing stimulating content late at night that could disrupt good sleeping habits over time . it s also suggested individuals create designated areas within their home dedicated solely for winding down before getting ready for bed with no digital devices present whether it being reading books knowledgeably proven not associated with insomnia inducing material or even taking part in mindfulness exercises such as yoga stretches",0,0,0.0003293522012448175

"seeking multiple opinions when making an important decision or asking for advice is beneficial for a few key reasons firstly, different people will have varied perspectives, experiences, and areas of expertise that can provide unique insights. no single person can possibly have considered all angles of a complex situation. getting input from more than one source allows you to develop a more well rounded understanding of issues involved and factors to weigh carefully. secondly, multiple viewpoints help identify biases or blind spots someone may have if only consulting their own viewpoint. people naturally see things partially from their own life lens and no one is objective 100 of the time. others can point out assumptions made or altnerative ways of thinking about things that broaden one's analysis. catching potential blind spots early aids making the most informed choice. thirdly, common themes or consistent advice across opinions strengthens the likelihood of their validity over singular recommendations. if different people reach similar conclusions independently, that consensus lending should carry more weight than any one individual take. conversely, identifying inconsistent or conflicting advice highlights areas needing further reflection before deciding. finally, seeking a variety of counsel empowers someone not to rely too heavily on any single source and avoid potential pitfalls of overconfidence in one person's counsel. it gives the opportunity to weigh different perspectives rationally rather than make an emotional decision based on one limited view. the multilayered insight makes it less like an individual's potential biases could sway the final choice. in conclusion, making well considered decisions is aided by accessing viewpoints beyond just one person. the diversity of multiple credible opinions helps gain a more well rounded evaluation of situations from more life experiences and prevents relying too narrowly on any singular assessment. it strengthens one's ability to make the best informed choice overall.",0,0,0.00044527049003946056
"i agree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. i think this is a great decision because it will make students more well rounded and help them develop important skills. firstly, participating in extracurricular activities can help students learn new skills. for example, if a student joins the school's drama club, they will learn how to act, memorize lines, and perform in front of an audience. or, if a student joins the school's robotics club, they will learn how to build and program robots. these skills can be useful in the future, whether the student decides to pursue a career in acting or engineering. secondly, extracurricular activities can make students more well rounded. if a student only focuses on their academics, they may miss out on other important aspects of life. by participating in extracurricular activities, students can learn about teamwork, leadership, and time management. they can also make new friends and discover new interests. in conclusion, i believe that all students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. it will help them learn new skills and become more well rounded individuals.",0,0,6.24572735961888e-05

"dear principal, i think that students should not have their phones at school at all because not all students will listen to the rules. one reason i choose policy 2 is because some kids would use them during class and then they would get in trouble. they would be used to cheat on tests, text friends, and get on the internet. many kids would use them to look up answers for papers, tests, homework, or any other projects. some might even use them to get on chat rooms or any other website, like facebook and myspace. some students would then forget to turn them off, if they were allowed to have them on during free times. then they would become a interruption to the educational process. teachers would have to stop class and have to tell the student to turn it off or even some teachers would take the phones. many kids would have to pick up the phones at the end of the day so they didn't get in trouble again. more kids would get their phones out after they finish something in class, like homework or a project even if they weren't allowed. many students would get in trouble with their phones then without them. some students could even use the cameras on their phones to take mean pictures or inappropriate pictures. there would be more bullying going on with classmates and friends. mean stuff could be sent around the school about other kids. some kids would even send out rumors causing someone to get hurt. there would be more causes of kids getting bullied if students were allowed their phones. many students would use them so much during lunch that they would get into their conversations with others that they would not eat their lunch. that would have more students wasting their lunches. sometimes there would even be a ton of leftovers that the cooks made and then you would eat the leftovers the next day for lunch. students having their phones could cause some major damage to friendships and grades. that is why i think you should not allow students to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, even if they are turned off during class time.",1,1,0.9981031585566066

"in his time as a british minister, winston churchill famously said that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. this statement holds true today, as many people continue to fail and give up on their dreams. however, churchill's words remind us that failure is not the end, but rather an opportunity for growth and improvement. one of the reasons that failure plays a crucial role in success is that it teaches us what went wrong. when we fail, we are forced to examine our actions and identify the areas where we need to improve. this process of self reflection can be uncomfortable, but it ultimately leads to better decision making and a greater chance of success in the future. another reason that failure is important is that it makes us stronger. when we face adversity, we are forced to push ourselves beyond our limits and find new sources of strength within ourselves. this process of overcoming failure can be difficult, but it ultimately leads to greater resilience and a better ability to handle future challenges. finally, failure can help us become better people. when we fail, we are forced to confront our weaknesses and vulnerabilities, which can lead to personal growth and self improvement. this process of self discovery can be challenging, but it ultimately leads to a more fulfilling and meaningful life. in conclusion, while failure may seem like a setback at first, it ultimately plays a crucial role in success. by learning from our mistakes, becoming stronger, and growing as individuals, we can turn our failures into stepping stones on the path to success. so, the next time you fail, don't give up. instead, take the opportunity to learn and try again until you succeed.",0,0,8.109968928177166e-06

"while the idea of automated vehicles may seem appealing, especially to those who enjoy the luxury of having a personal chauffeur, it is essential to consider the potential risks and challenges associated with this technology. in my opinion, the drawbacks of driverless cars outweigh their benefits, and we should proceed with caution before embracing this innovation. one of the primary concerns with driverless cars is safety. as the article highlights, the shift from human control to machine control raises questions about the reliability of sensors and algorithms. no matter how advanced these systems may be, they are not infallible, and the possibility of technical failure or malfunction is always present. moreover, the dependence on technology may lead to distraction or drowsiness, which could be catastrophic in situations requiring immediate human intervention. the article also raises the ethical dilemma of liability in the event of accidents, which could lead to complex legal battles. another issue with driverless cars is the potential erosion of basic skills and situational awareness. as we rely more and more on technology, we risk losing the ability to navigate and respond to situations independently. this could lead to a disconnection from the act of driving and a lack of awareness of our surroundings, which is essential for safe and responsible driving. furthermore, the cost of developing and owning driverless cars could create a divide between those who can afford this technology and those who cannot, exacerbating socio economic disparities. on the other hand, advocates for driverless cars argue that they represent a significant technological achievement and will propel society forward. while this may be true, it is crucial to balance innovation with caution and consider the potential impacts on society, economy, and individual autonomy. the convenience of having a car drive itself may be appealing, but it is not worth sacrificing human independence, skill, and safety. in conclusion, while driverless cars may seem like a novelty, we must be cautious in our approach to adopting this technology. the potential risks and challenges associated with driverless cars outweigh their benefits, and we must prioritize safety, skill, and awareness. we must navigate the road to the future thoughtfully and ensure that technological progress does not come at the cost of human autonomy.",0,0,2.9903112964459127e-06

"dear senator name , as a concerned citizen of our state and a passionate advocate of the electoral process, i am writing to voice my opinion on the electoral college. i strongly believe that the electoral college should be retained as it ensures certainty of outcome, requires candidates to have a broad, transregional appeal, focuses attention on swing states, balances the influence of large states, and avoids the need for run off elections. it is a stabilizing factor in our representative democratic process that has served us well over the years. critics of the electoral college argue that it is an outdated, non democratic system for electing a president. they believe that the popular vote winner should be elected instead. however, i disagree with them because the electoral college guarantees that every vote counts, regardless of where it is cast. it ensures the representation of the minority as well as the majority, which is essential for our democracy. moreover, the electoral college has prevented several instances of electoral fraud and corruption, ensuring a fair and legitimate election. it also allows for a more efficient electoral process without the need for a recount or run off elections, which can be time consuming and costly. in conclusion, i urge you to support the continued use of the electoral college as it has proven to be a stable and effective system for electing a president. it is vital to maintain our country's electoral process, and the electoral college plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and fairness of our democracy. thank you for your time and consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,8.849323674673541e-05

"dear principal, i am writing to respectfully provide my perspective on the school's cell phone policy options under consideration. upon reviewing policy 1 and policy 2, i believe that policy 1 is the better choice for our school. here are a few reasons why policy 1 allows limited and responsible cell phone use during free periods like lunch. for many students, having their phones during the school day provides a sense of safety and means of contacting family if needed. banning phones altogether may cause undue stress or worry. policy 1 balances this need for connection with the importance of focusing without distractions during class time. keeping phones put away during class under policy 1 also sets students up for success. we want to foster an environment where learning can take place without technology serving as a distraction. however, an outright ban seems overly restrictive and could backfire by tempting some to secretly use their devices anyway. policy 1 establishes clear rules that are reasonable for students to follow. finally, policy 1 is more reflective of the real world responsibilities most students will face after graduation. a full phone ban does not adequately prepare students for integrating technology into work and school life in a focused, structured way. policy 1 s limited hours of permission help students practice effective self monitoring and time management with their devices. in summary, i believe policy 1 is the optimal choice as it considers students' needs while also supporting focus during academic hours. thank you for thoughtfully considering my perspective on this important topic. please let me know if you need any additional information. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.003454883717066249
"many people believe that the invention of driverless cars is a major sea forward for technology, and that someday, all cars will be driverless. there are both positive and negative aspects of this. people who are used to driving may not like the idea of relying on technology to get around, and there are also concerns about hacking and safety. however, driverless cars have the potential to significantly reduce the number of accidents and save lives. they may also be more efficient and convenient than human driven cars. for these reasons, i believe that the development of driverless cars should continue. the article driverless cars are coming argues that driverless cars could reduce traffic accidents. according to the article, over 90 of accidents are due to human error. the article also states that driverless cars have the potential to save time and reduce traffic congestion. i believe that if driverless cars are properly developed and regulated, they could potentially save many lives and make our roads safer. however, there are also several concerns about driverless cars that need to be addressed. one of the biggest concerns is safety. if a driverless car is hacked, it could be dangerous. there are also concerns about how driverless cars will interact with human driven cars. in conclusion, i believe that the development of driverless cars should continue, but that there needs to be a thorough investigation of their safety and potential impact on society.",0,0,0.01100937029956852

"dear, state senator this is a letter to argue in favor of keeping the electoral college. there are many reasons to keep the electoral college one reason is because it is widely regarded as an anachronism, a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible, but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote, and the electoral college restores some weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virus of the mal apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. i am in favor of keeping the electoral college because, it is widely regarded as an anachronism. a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. the advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the electoral college method is not democratic in a method sense. it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. but each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed . another, reason i am in favor of keeping the electoral college is because, a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible. but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. last but not least, i am in favor of keeping the electoral college is because, the electoral college restores some weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virus of the mal apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. a larger state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. it can be argued that electoral college methods of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidates who has no hope of carrying their state. but of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about 1 2 the eligible american population did vote in the 2012's election. from, proper name",1,0,0.15021988792851917

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the electoral college. i believe that the electoral college is an outdated and undemocratic institution that is no longer necessary in the 21st century. the electoral college was created in 1787 at the constitutional convention. at the time, the united states was a much smaller country, and the founding fathers were concerned that a popular vote for president would give too much power to the large states. they believed that the electoral college would ensure that all states had a voice in the presidential election. however, the united states has changed dramatically since 1787. be are now a much larger country, and the electoral college no longer serves the same purpose. in fact, the electoral college often gives more power to the small states than they deserve. for example, in the 2016 election, hillary clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, but donald trump won the electoral college and became president. this is because trump won a majority of the electoral votes in a number of small states, even though he lost the popular vote in most of the country. the electoral college also makes it possible for a candidate to win the presidency without winning the popular vote. this has happened five times in american history, most recently in 2016. this is undemocratic and unfair to the majority of voters. i believe that the electoral college should be abolished and that the president should be elected by popular vote. this would ensure that the president is elected by the majority of voters, and it would give all states an equal voice in the election. i urge you to support abolishing the electoral college. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.0021420348409297305

"title the benefits of waiting to commit to a career in high school as an 8th grader, i have often wondered about the benefits of waiting to commit to a career until later in high school. while some people may think that deciding on a career path early on is important, i believe that there are several advantages to waiting. firstly, high school is a time of exploration and discovery. it's an opportunity to try out different extracurricular activities, sports, and clubs to find what truly interests us. by waiting to commit to a career, we can explore different fields and gain a deeper understanding of what we want to pursue. for example, i may have initially thought i wanted to be a doctor, but after volunteering at a local hospital, i realized that i don't enjoy the hanson aspect of medicine and would rather pursue a career in writing. secondly, waiting to commit to a career allows us to gain more life experience. high school is a time of growth and development, both academically and personally. by taking a break from the pressures of choosing a career, we can focus on our studies, build meaningful relationships with friends and family, and develop important life skills such as time management and problem solving. these experiences will help us make a more informed decision when it comes to choosing a career. however, i also believe that ineffective studying practices can lead to failure in a chosen career. many students rush through their coursework, not fully understanding the material or putting in the necessary effort to succeed. this can lead to poor grades, low self esteem, and a lack of motivation to pursue a career in their chosen field. it's important to strike a balance between exploring different career paths and putting in the effort to succeed in our studies. in conclusion, while some may argue that deciding on a career path early on is important, i believe that there are several benefits to waiting to commit to a career until later in high school. by taking the time to explore different fields, gain life experience, and develop important skills, we can make a more informed decision when it comes to choosing a career. additionally, avoiding ineffective studying practices is crucial to success in any chosen field.",0,0,3.5612038412128706e-05
"today, almost everyone has a cellphone. it has become an essential part of our life. we use it for communication, browsing the internet, and even for entertainment. however, when it comes to driving, there is a debate on whether drivers should or should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity. in my opinion, drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. it is dangerous and can lead to accidents. when a driver is on their phone, they are not fully focused on the road. they might not see the traffic signal, or they might not be able to react quickly enough to avoid a collision. furthermore, using a cellphone while driving is distracting. even if the driver is not talking on the phone, texting, or browsing the internet, the phone's notifications can be distracting, and it can take the driver's attention off the road. it only takes a second of not paying attention to the road to cause an accident that could result in injury or loss of life. moreover, many countries have already banned the use of cell phones while driving. for example, in the united kingdom, using a handheld phone while driving is illegal. in australia, drivers are only allowed to use hands free devices. to sum up, using a cellphone while driving is dangerous, distracting, and can result in accidents. therefore, drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. it is essential to prioritize road safety over the need to use our cell phones.",0,0,0.045297491220254275

"distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many students and educators alike advocating for its benefits. while some argue that attending school in person is essential for students' development, others believe that distance learning provides a more flexible and personalized education. in this essay, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning and its impact on students and schools. one of the main benefits of distance learning is that it allows students to attend school from the comfort of their own home. this can be particularly beneficial for students with disabilities or health problems, as they can learn at their own pace and in a more comfortable environment. additionally, distance learning can help students with busy schedules or those who live far from their school to attend classes without disrupting their daily routines. however, some argue that distance learning can lead to a lack of discipline and responsibility among students. without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may be more likely to procrastinate or miss classes. furthermore, some students may struggle with the lack of social interaction and support that comes with distance learning. another potential disadvantage of distance learning is that it may not provide the same level of personalized attention as a traditional classroom. teachers may have a harder time identifying and addressing individual student needs, and students may not receive the same level of feedback and guidance. despite these potential drawbacks, many students and educators believe that distance learning can be a valuable option for education. by providing a more flexible and personalized education, distance learning can help students achieve their full potential and reach their academic goals. additionally, distance learning can help schools reduce costs and improve efficiency, allowing them to allocate resources more effectively. in conclusion, distance learning is a complex issue with both advantages and disadvantages. while it may not be the best option for all students, it can provide a valuable alternative for those who need it. ultimately, the decision to pursue distance learning should be based on individual needs and circumstances, and should be carefully considered by both students and educators.",0,0,1.0985230399646636e-07
"the development of driverless cars while driverless cars hold promise for improved safety and mobility, their widespread adoption also raises valid ethical concerns that warrant careful consideration. according to the article driverless cars are coming , autonomous vehicles could significantly reduce accidents caused by human error on the road. without distracted, tired, or impaired drivers at the wheel, these cars may help prevent thousands of crashes and save countless lives each year through their precise sensing and computerized decision making. however, the article also notes the uncertainty around how driverless cars will handle emergency situations like crashes or malfunctions. when does a car choose to brake and potentially harm passengers to avoid hitting pedestrians? who is at fault if an autonomous system fails and an accident occurs? these types of ethical dilemmas underscore the need for extensive testing and oversight before deploying self driving cars without human supervision. researchers and policymakers must carefully study how artificial intelligence systems in vehicles prioritize safety decisions to best minimize harm. the public will also need reassurances that personal privacy and data security are protected. while the future benefits of autonomous mobility seem clear, introducing such transformative technology also carries responsibilities to address limitations and risks. rather than rushing blindly towards a driverless future, all stakeholders would be wise to move forward deliberately through open discussion and collaboration. with patience and prudence, many of today's uncertainties could be resolved, allowing society to eventually realize the full promise of this innovation. overall, driverless cars show great potential if their development proceeds judiciously and with due care for human well being.",0,0,6.757027182656261e-05

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the electoral college. as you know, the electoral college is a system in which each state is allocated a number of electors equal to its number of seats in the house of representatives plus its two senators. the candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives all of that state's electoral votes, except in maine and nebraska, which award their electoral votes by congressional district. the electoral college was created at the 1787 constitutional convention as a compromise between those who wanted the president to be elected by congress and those who wanted the president to be elected by a popular vote of the people. the framers of the constitution believed that the electoral college would prevent a demagogue from being elected president by appealing to the passions of the masses. however, i believe that the electoral college is an outdated and undemocratic system. in recent elections, the popular vote winner has lost the electoral college vote twice in 2000 and 2016. this means that millions of americans have had their votes cast aside. the electoral college also gives an unfair advantage to small states. the smallest state, wyoming, has three electoral votes, even though it has a population of only 577,737 people. the largest state, california, has 55 electoral votes, even though it has a population of 39,536,653 people. this means that the vote of someone in wyoming is worth 3.6 times more than the vote of someone in california. i believe that the united states should adopt a national popular vote for president. this would give every voter an equal voice in the election. it would also ensure that the president is elected by the majority of the people. i urge you to support abolishing the electoral college and adopting a national popular vote for president. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.11253192062052933

"dear state senator, i am writing you this letter to argue about removing the electoral college. using the electoral college has caused some disruption when its it comes to the votes. from the article the indefensible electoral college it says that under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors . who are the electors? well anyone can be an elector not holding public office. can voters control whom their electors vote for? no. these are one of the reasons to remove the electoral college. also, the electoral college should be removed because of the 2000 voting fiasco that happened. from the article the indefensible electoral college it says it was the biggest election crisis in the century . consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors will always defy the will of the people. if we the people vote for our choice to run this country their should not be any of these fiascos. next, even presidents, afl cio in their time have agreed with this. they all want to remove the electoral college. according to the article a gallup pole in 2000, taken shortly after algore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but won the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. finally, the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. this system should be removed you might not know what elector you are voting for or after that 2000 fiasco why would you still have the electoral college. in conclusion, these are my reasons why the electoral college should be removed. first, you won't know what elector you are voting for. next, the 2000 fiasco. finally, because it is unfair, outdated and irrational.",1,1,0.999722788631995
"making mona lisa smile is a fascinating article that introduces us to the facial action coding system facs , a groundbreaking technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. this technology has the potential to revolutionize various fields, including education. however, the question remains is using facs to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom valuable? on one hand, proponents of facs argue that it can help teachers understand their students better. by analyzing facial expressions, teachers can identify when a student is confused, bored, or engaged. this information can be used to tailor lessons to better suit individual students' needs, ultimately improving their learning experience. additionally, facs could help identify students who may be struggling with mental health issues, allowing teachers to provide support and resources. on the other hand, critics raise concerns about privacy and the potential for misuse. students may feel uncomfortable knowing that their every facial expression is being monitored and analyzed. furthermore, there's a risk that this technology could be used to label or stereotype students based on their emotional responses. for example, a student who frequently displays negative emotions might be unfairly labeled as difficult or uncooperative. in my opinion, while facs has great potential, its use in classrooms should be approached with caution. teachers must ensure that they respect students' privacy and use the technology responsibly. additionally, facs should not be relied upon as the sole method for understanding students' emotions it should be used in conjunction with other methods, such as open communication and observation of behavior. in conclusion, while the use of facs in classrooms has both potential benefits and drawbacks, i believe that if used responsibly and in conjunction with other methods, it could provide valuable insights into students' emotional states and ultimately improve their learning experience. however, it's crucial that we proceed with caution and prioritize students' privacy and well being.",0,0,2.3882200756999935e-06
"limiting car usage has numerous benefits for individuals, society, and the environment. while some may argue that reducing car usage will negatively impact daily life and the economy, the evidence suggests otherwise. gne of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is improved air quality. cars are a significant source of air pollution, emitting harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. according to the world health organization who , exposure to air pollution is responsible for an estimated 7 million premature deaths worldwide each year. by reducing car usage, we can significantly reduce air pollution, improving public health and quality of life. another benefit of limiting car usage is reduced traffic congestion. traffic congestion is a significant problem in many cities, causing frustration and wasted time for commuters. according to the texas a m transportation institute, the average american spends 42 hours per year stuck in traffic, which costs the economy 124 billion in lost productivity. by promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit, cycling, and walking, we can reduce traffic congestion and improve the efficiency of our transportation systems. limiting car usage can also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which are a significant contributor to climate change. cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for around 15 of global emissions. by promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can reduce our reliance on cars and lower greenhouse gas emissions, helping to mitigate the impacts of climate change. some may argue that limiting car usage will negatively impact the economy, particularly in areas where car manufacturing and sales are significant industries. however, the evidence suggests that promoting alternative modes of transportation can actually stimulate economic growth. for example, a study by the institute for transportation and development",0,0,9.818782749949205e-06

"research has shown that distance learning has both its pros and cons for student performance. on one hand, it provides convenience and flexibility, allowing students to attend classes from the comfort of their own homes. it also eliminates the need to commute from place to place and can provide access to courses and educational resources that are otherwise not available in traditional settings. on the other hand, distance learning has drawbacks as well. without the benefit of direct teacher instruction, students can experience a lack of guidance and support, as well as feeling a reduction in motivation and engagement. additionally, online classes can be more susceptible to cheating and plagiarism due to the anonymity of the environment. although distance learning can be beneficial for students, it should not be viewed as a replacement for more traditional forms of education. unperson instruction provides a greater sense of community, as well as increased collaboration and interaction with experienced faculty. furthermore, traditional classrooms can offer more individualized learning options and provide access to academic and social resources that are not available in an online environment. by understanding the advantages and disadvantages of both forms of education, students can make more informed decisions about the type of learning which is best suited for their individual needs and interests.",0,0,3.701951517692719e-08

"many people are under the impression that camping is a leisurely activity reserved only for those who enjoy a more rugged lifestyle. while it s true that camping can involve some of nature s more challenging elements, such as navigating rough terrain or dealing with unpredictable weather conditions, there is much more to the hobby than just these aspects. camping has so many benefits when done right and can be an incredibly rewarding experience for both individuals and families alike. first off, by getting out into nature, we afford ourselves the opportunity to detox from our day to day lives and disconnect from technology in order to appreciate all of its beauty. it helps us gain perspective on what matters most in life being present in the moment and taking time out of our busy schedules to enjoy meaningful connection with one another. time spent in nature helps reduce stress levels, allowing us to recharge our mental and physical batteries while enjoying quality time together doing something different than usual at home. additionally, camping provides excellent opportunities for activities like fishing or hiking which give us a chance to explore new places while gathering memories along the way. whether packing up your gear for an overnight trip or setting up a tent near a lake where you plan on staying longer term, every camping adventure presents unique experiences that you won't find anywhere else helping you uncover hidden gems tucked away deep within forests or uncover panoramic views atop mountain tops after making your way through winding paths en route there!. . finally though it may not seem logical given how much work often goes into preparing equipment before setting off recent studies have proven that going camping regularly comes with significant health benefits due how humanity evolved when humans lived outdoors they had better sleep cycles due exposure during daytime hours which triggers natural circadian rhythms as well as increased adrenaline from keeping themselves safe against possible threats encountered outside their home environment this improved overall metabolism leading too less stress hormones being released over sustained periods of time resulting in improved mental performance",0,0,0.00011189711994492875

"dear principal, with a grade a average many students can achieve goals beyond imagination. they could eventually become a scientist, a lawyer, a successful business owner, or an engineer. as the grades get lower and lower, the possibilities dwindle down until all dreams are forfeited. a b average should be the lowest average if someone is going to be able to get the benefits of playing sports or having any extracurricular activities. if students give up school work, and give little effort, then the ending result will not be very surprising. to be able to have benefits in life, such as sports, a person should be able to earn the right to them. education is very important, considering it is what makes up the first twenty or so years of life. it is a fortune that many of us are lucky enough to go to school, but to disgrace that privilege by not even trying is unjust. many people around the world don't get the right to go to school. they must be forced at a very young age to work for their family's wellbeing. sports are not the only way to get into successful jobs later on in life. music, art, and literature are always students can get into college on scholarship. the academics in college are also required, and for the benefit of those athletically inclined, having both good academics and great sports can't hurt at all. ealling below the average b would make someone's chances at getting into college much harder, even with a great talent such at football, baseball, soccer, tennis, etc. so, i say that by applying a rule to having a b grade average, this would only benefit the boys and girls at my school to be the most talented that they can be. in no way does this code hurt my chances nor anyone else's at achieving their dreams and goals. thank you for your time, student name",1,1,0.9975053905073095

"title exploring venus venus is the second planet from the sun in our solar system. it is often called earth's sister planet since they share many similarities in size, mass, and composition. however, there are significant differences between the two that make venus an intriguing and unique place to explore. 1. atmosphere venus has an incredibly dense and hot atmosphere, which makes it very challenging to explore. the surface pressure on venus is about 90 times greater than that on earth, and its atmosphere is composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid droplets. the temperature on the ground can reach a scorching 864 degrees fahrenheit 462 degrees celsius , making it the hottest planet in our solar system. 2. cloud cover the thick cloud cover on venus makes it difficult for scientists to observe the surface directly. the clouds are mostly composed of sulfuric acid, which can damage instruments sent to explore the planet's surface. 3. surface features venus is covered in volcanic plains and highland regions, with some evidence of tectonic activity. there are no signs of active volcanism, but scientists believe there might be hot spots underground that could cause occasional volcanic activity. 4. magnetic field and core unlike earth, which has a strong magnetic field that protects it from solar wind, venus has no global magnetic field. this makes its atmosphere vulnerable to being stripped away by solar wind. scientists are still trying to understand the reason behind venus' lack of a magnetic field. 5. climate venus has a runaway greenhouse effect, meaning that its atmosphere is trapping heat from solar radiation. this results in a very hot surface temperature. the lack of a magnetic field and the dense atmosphere make it difficult for life as we know it to exist on venus. in conclusion, venus is a fascinating planet with many mysteries waiting to be unraveled. exploring its atmosphere, cloud cover, surface features, magnetic field, and climate can provide valuable insights into our solar system and the potential for life beyond earth.",0,0,0.002361333038872872

"society owes a great debt of gratitude to those who are gifted at perceiving and coordinating the talents and skills of others. however, it is equally important to recognize the value of those who develop their own new ideas. while both types of individuals can make significant contributions to society, i disagree with the statement that the former are more important. it is undeniable that those with the capacity to organize the efforts of others can have far reaching positive impacts. take, for instance, the work of sir richard branson, a british businessman who has built a global empire uniting the talents of hundreds of thousands of people. branson s skill in business management has enabled him to amass a fortune, which he has used to fund charitable initiatives such as virgin unite, an organization that helps to reduce poverty and tackle climate change. nevertheless, it is equally crucial to recognize the value of those who generate new concepts. these individuals have the power to push the boundaries of science, technology, and the arts, allowing us to make advances in fields such as healthcare, education, and communication. a notable example is of mohammed runs, a bangladeshi economist and nobel laureate who developed the concept of microfinance. this system has enabled millions of people in developing countries to access the funds they need to start or expand small businesses, reducing poverty and improving economic equity. it is also important to consider the role of creative thinkers in driving social change. these individuals are often seen as the catalysts behind major reforms, from martin luther king s civil rights campaign in the united states to mahatma gandhi s nonviolent resistance in india. without the originality and courage of such visionaries, it is unlikely that the world would be as progressive as it is today. the ability to coordinate the efforts of others is undoubtedly an advantageous skill, and those who possess it can have a lasting impact on society. however, it is equally essential to recognize the value of those who develop their own innovative ideas, whether they be business, scientific, or social. without the creativity of such individuals, the world would be a much less interesting and progressive place.",0,0,1.332304484175309e-05

"making mona lisa smile introduces the facial action coding system facs , a groundbreaking technology that can analyze the emotional expressions of human beings. the article raises concerns about the use of this technology in educational settings, citing privacy and practicality issues. in my opinion, the use of emotion detecting technology in classrooms is not necessary and may even be intrusive. firstly, the article highlights that the human brain is naturally capable of understanding emotions through facial expressions, rendering the need for facs redundant. teachers already possess the innate ability to sense and respond to their students' emotions effectively. therefore, the implementation of technology to detect emotions is unnecessary and may even be a distraction in the learning process. moreover, the use of emotion detecting technology raises privacy concerns. the facs system can recognize emotions like confusion or boredom, but it lacks the capacity to understand the underlying causes of these emotions. the personal experiences and emotions that students bring to the classroom are diverse, and the application of emotion detection technology could lead to invasive scrutiny of their private emotional states. this could exacerbate their distress, leading to a negative impact on their learning experience. furthermore, the practicality and financial costs of implementing emotion detecting technology in classrooms are significant. the article suggests that computers equipped with facs could adapt teaching methods in real time to maintain student engagement. however, this approach could disrupt the learning process for other students in group settings, leading to a negative impact on their learning experience. additionally, the implementation of personalized emotion detecting computers for each student would entail significant financial investments, making it an impractical solution for most educational institutions. in conclusion, the article raises valid concerns about the use of emotion detecting technology in educational settings. the potential benefits of personalized learning experiences through emotion detection technology are overshadowed by practical and financial constraints. it is crucial to remember the value of human touch in education, a realm where emotional understanding and connection are paramount. the use of emotion detecting technology in classrooms may be unnecessary and even intrusive, leading to a negative impact on the learning experience. therefore, it is essential to approach technological integration in education with caution and respect for privacy.",0,0,0.0002207756803396276

"as a scientist at nasa, my goal is to provide accurate information and dispel myths about the face on mars. the article unmasking the face on mars provides compelling evidence that the face is simply a natural landform, and not a sign of alien life. firstly, it's important to note that the face was not initially considered a potential site for alien life by nasa. the viking 1 spacecraft captured the image, and it was later popularized by the media and conspiracy theorists. nasa's mars global surveyor was sent to photograph cydonia in 1997, and the resulting images revealed the face to be a natural butte or mesa, similar to those found on earth. additionally, laser altimetry was used to confirm that the face is a natural formation, and not a product of intelligent design. the altimetry data shows that the face is part of a larger geological feature, which suggests that it was formed by natural processes over time. furthermore, the geological significance of cydonia lies in its location at a potential ancient martian ocean boundary. this information is crucial to understanding the history of mars and the factors that contributed to its geological features. in conclusion, the evidence presented in unmasking the face on mars clearly shows that the face is a natural landform, and not a product of intelligent design. while it may be disappointing to those who believe in extraterrestrial life on mars, it's important to rely on scientific data and evidence to make informed conclusions. as a scientist at nasa, i am committed to providing accurate information and dispelling myths about the face on mars.",0,0,6.593395123935322e-05
"dear mr. senator, i have decided to express my opinon to you about the electoral college process for electing the president of the united states. this process should be abolished as soon as possible for it is corrosive to the american peoples opinon. we should instead switch to a popular vote by eligble american citizens to decide presidency. now some fellows might argue that the electoral college is favored by the people. when in fact, as bradford plumer points out in paragraph 9, 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now . some people may also say that the electoral college ecourages the president to visit all states, when in fact smaller states still are not treated the same as states with more electoral votes. a president would rather spend their time investing and giving information to a state such as californa who have 55 electoral votes, who feel more inclined to think about their decision due to their involvement, rather than a state with 3 electoral votes who dont invest as much thought into their votes. in grade school we are taught that popualer votes most accurately represent what a specific population wants, why dont we use it in the real world? if your princible wanted to figure out what color the students wanted their yearbooks, she would not elect people to decide for each class! in the bush and gore election, bush recived less votes by the american people but won presidency because he accuired more electoral votes than gore. that means that more american people wanted gore, but the fate was chosen by 271 people, who selected bush as the winner! the electoral college also increases the risk of a tie and if one occured, the election would be disrupted by the unorderly process of which we would have to take to decide the president. in 1968, a change of votes from just 41,971 people would have tied the electoral votes due to the even number of 538 electors. the overall idea im trying to express is that the electoral college is a poor way to show peoples opinon, and much rather focuses on that of 270 individuals who in the end, decide the president of the united states. i hope you can see my points and i long for the day when the president is decided by the people.",1,1,0.9983279813190713

"in the article the challenge of exploring venus by author's name , several points are made that support my argument. the author effectively emphasizes how exploration of venus can offer a wealth of scientific knowledge that can enhance our comprehension of the universe, highlighting the planet's similarities in size and proximity to earth, which can reveal important aspects of planetary science. for example, venus' thick atmosphere, composed primarily of carbon dioxide, offers insights into the effects of greenhouse gases that are relevant to understanding our world's climate change. the article cites how recent technological concepts like floating research stations, above the surface's extreme temperatures, can make gathering data for an extended period feasible. it also highlights the importance of balancing risk and reward, underscoring the significance of developing innovative technologies that withstand venus' environment. these advancements could have long term benefits for planetary exploratory missions. furthermore, the author highlights that venus's relatively close proximity to earth when the planets are aligned in their orbits makes it relatively accessible to us for exploration. although the challenges are undeniable, the scientific rewards are substantial. the pursuit of venus can be seen as a continuation of humanity's age old quest for knowledge that can potentially have far reaching implications for the future. overall, the article successfully argues that despite the obstacles of exploring venus, the scientific gains justify the efforts. venus' unique characteristics and proximity to earth make it an inviting target for further exploration, and advancements in space technology could help us better understand this planet. the author effectively presents the idea that pursuing the exploration of venus is a worthy pursuit, despite the potential difficulties, and i firmly agree with this assessment. to summarize, the author offers a robust defense of studying venus despite its hazardous conditions, pointing to the significant scientific advantages that come with exploring our neighboring planet, and by highlighting current and potential technologies that can help us navigate these difficulties and pave the way for future discoveries, they effectively demonstrate the value that can come from pursuing such a mission.",0,0,3.2345056805587946e-05

"dear state senator's name , as a concerned citizen and student of politics, i am writing to express my opinion on the electoral college system used to elect the president of the united states. while some argue that the electoral college is outdated and unfair, i believe it is still a crucial part of our democratic system and should be kept or changed to election by popular vote. one of the most significant arguments in favor of the electoral college is that it ensures a certainty of outcome. as judge richard a. poster notes in in defense of the electoral college, a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible, but less likely than a dispute over the popular vote poster, 2004 . ahis is particularly important in a country as diverse as the united states, where a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. by requiring a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal, the electoral college ensures that the president will have the support of the entire country. another advantage of the electoral college is that it induces presidential candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states, where the election is closest. as bradford plume argues in ahe indefensible electoral college, this leads to more thoughtful voters in those states, as they know their vote will decide the election plume, 2004 . in contrast, a popular vote system would likely lead to candidates ignoring smaller states and focusing solely on the largest ones. moreover, the electoral college restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose due to the apportionment of the senate. as poster notes, a victory by the same margin in wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral",0,0,0.009170907578686952
"in the past few decades, the number of cars on the road has increased dramatically. this has led to a number of problems, including traffic congestion, air pollution, and urban sprawl. in order to address these problems, it is necessary to limit car usage. there are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. first, it would reduce traffic congestion. when there are fewer cars on the road, traffic moves more smoothly and there are fewer accidents. this would save time and money for everyone. second, limiting car usage would improve air quality. cars are a major source of air pollution, and reducing the number of cars on the road would help to clean the air. this would benefit everyone, especially people with respiratory problems. third, limiting car usage would reduce urban sprawl. as more people drive, they need more space to live, work, and shop. this leads to the development of new suburbs and shopping malls on the outskirts of cities. these developments can be harmful to the environment, as they often require the clearing of forests and other natural areas. there are a number of ways to limit car usage. one way is to improve public transportation. if people have a convenient and affordable way to get around without a car, they are more likely to use it. another way to limit car usage is to make it more expensive to drive. this can be done by raising the price of gasoline or by increasing the cost of parking. limiting car usage would have a number of benefits for society. it would reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and reduce urban sprawl. these benefits would make our cities more livable and sustainable. in conclusion, there are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. it would reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and reduce urban sprawl. these benefits would make our cities more livable and sustainable. we should take steps to limit car usage in order to create a better future for ourselves and for future generations.",0,0,0.00021210197767616734
"dear state senator, i think the voting should be based off of the most popular vote. when we so to vote all we're voting for is electors to vote for the president they choose. in my opinion the people of the united states of america should set a saying in whom they want as president. if the voting was based off of the most popular vote, it would be fair to everyone. for example in 2000 when al sore received more individual votes than george w. bush and bush one, that was unfair because more people wanted al gore as their president rather than george w. bush. the president is sons to be all the people in the united states president, not just those 29 electoral voters' president. in 2012 obama won the election because of the 61.7 percent of the electoral votes not by individual votes. if the voting wasn't based off of the electoral votes than maybe the united states wouldn't be so much in debt and have so many people not wanting obama as our president. maybe romney would have been a better president and have taken the u.s. out of so much debt. after all, 53.1 percent of individual voters voted for romney. romney's chances of winning by electoral college were thin because since he was in the south he had no incentive to campaign heavily in those south states. many voters don't vote because they know their vote won't matter at all when it comes to voting for the president of their choosing. if 35 million people vote in california, it would only count as 55 representatives. is their really a point of them voting? no point at all. in conclusion, if you really want a fair win for the president, the president should be chosen by the people, not the electoral college. when i'm old enough to vote i hope it will be based off of whom the people want as their president not the electoral college. sincerely, a student whose parents voted for romney.",1,1,0.9997393459123087

"when it comes to the topic of body image and self worth, there is an increasing concern among people in modern society. this phenomenon has been linked with the rise of social media platforms, which present a certain ideal standard of beauty that many feel they cannot achieve or maintain. unfortunately, this can lead to a feeling of dissatisfaction and low self esteem due to a comparison between oneself and these unrealistic standards set by others online. one key factor as to why there is such pressure surrounding body image today lies within the influence of the fashion industry or advertising campaigns that promote very slender bodies as being attractive. on top of this, we are constantly exposed to images on our phones through instagram or other forms of media like television ads that reinforce those same ideals again and again leaving many individuals feeling inadequate in their own skin because they simply don't meet those expectations. social media influencers have also had an impact here as more followers equate often times with higher perceived approval ratings when it comes to appearance so naturally competition increases for users trying to look perfect from every angle all at once!. at its core, dealing with poor body image can be incredibly damaging if not addressed properly because it can lead someone down a path towards depression or eating disorders both conditions which require professional help if any progress is going be made towards recovery. fortunately however, there are lifestyle changes one can start implementing today in order to work towards improving self image over time such as engaging in positive affirmations each day especially around physical appearances , regularly checking up on mental health by speaking openly about feelings emotions practicing stress relief activities like yoga or meditation on occasions where worries become overwhelming doing whatever helps bring peace no matter how small at first step! finally try not ignore other aspects too nutrition fitness play huge roles here so make sure dieting doesn't get out control nor hard workouts become overbearing stresses themselves either just regular exercise routine helps balance everything out perfectly well alongside",0,0,0.006079911095253184

"dear principal, i think that the new school policy about students with at least a b average can only participate in sports or other activities is unfair. the reason i think this is because most students have c averages and are great athletes. also to some people c averages are okay. i think that most people with c averages probably failed a test or didn't bring in some homeworks and the reasons to punish them to not being in sports is absurd. sometimes students have a c and then it goes up or a c and they don't have time to make it up. i mean this never happened to me because i don't make c's or anything lower but telling people that they cannot join a sports team for it is so unreasonable. another specific reason is that people just don't have time or can't study. i think maybe having the team a little later when students get used to their studying and planning , then grades of school athletes might get better. the only thing i am arguing for is changing the policy from a b average to a c average because unless you don't want great athletes if so then i say you change it !",1,1,0.9997556607720549

"dear principal, i hope this letter finds you well. i am writing to you today to share my thoughts on the new cell phone policy being considered for our school. after careful consideration, i believe that policy 1 is the better option for our school. firstly, allowing students to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times will give us the opportunity to stay connected with our families and friends. in case of an emergency, it is important that we are able to reach out to our loved ones quickly and easily. additionally, having access to our phones during break times will allow us to listen to music or play games, which can help us relax and recharge before returning to class. secondly, having our phones with us throughout the day will encourage responsibility and trustworthiness. if we are allowed to have our phones with us, we will need to learn how to manage our time effectively and resist the temptation to use them during class time. this will help us develop important life skills that will serve us well in the future. lastly, banning phones altogether may cause more problems than it solves. if students are not allowed to have their phones with them, they may be more likely to sneak them into school or use them secretly during class time. this could result in more distractions and disruptions in the classroom, which would not be beneficial for anyone. in conclusion, i strongly believe that policy 1 is the better option for our school. allowing students to bring their phones to school and use them during break times will provide us with important benefits, while also encouraging responsibility and trustworthiness. thank you for considering my thoughts on this matter. sincerely, four name",0,0,0.0036548639381155565
"i believe that children should be taught to cooperate. competition is important, but cooperation is essential to success in life. when children are taught to cooperate, then learn to work together towards a common goal. this is a valuable skill that then can use in school, in their future careers, and in their personal lives. cooperation teaches children how to communicate and how to compromise. it also helps them to develop empathy and to understand different points of view. in a competitive environment, children often feel pressure to succeed. this can lead to anxiety and stress. it can also make children feel like then are not good enough. cooperation, on the other hand, allows children to feel supported and appreciated. when children feel good about themselves, then are more likely to be successful. of course, competition has its place. it can be a health wan to motivate children to do their best. but cooperation should be the foundation of a child s education. it is essential for developing well rounded, successful adults.",0,0,0.009042845665942937
"since our beautiful country was born we've always used the electoral college system to elect our presidents. it's time that we modify this old rule and change it to the popular vote, because it's simply unfair to all the hardworking people that leave work early and have to wait in line for hours to fill out a little white paper. the electoral does not allow for everyone's voice to be heard. clearly, the electoral college must change to the popular vote because of the winner age all method, the confusion. to begin with, the electoral college is outdated because of the winner age all system. even if the votes are off by one, whichever partakers the most popular votes acts all the electoral votes the united states are basically saying everybody else's voice that voted doesn't matter. this winner takes all system also deals with population, the baker the state the more electoral votes. this ancient system is clearly stating the citizens of the smaller states votes do not matter. although, the winner age all method induces the candidates to focus on the toss up states, it's still unfair to everyone. in addition, the electoral college is irrational because of all the confusion and trust issues. many of the citizens in our country don't even now what an electoral college is! plus the fact that most people thing they're voting for the president, but in reality they're voting for the slate of electors. it's also possible the electors that represent your party votes for the other candidate! another major reason the electoral college must be abolished is because the citizens do not even aet to choose their very own electors! it's life buying a new car while band blindfolded and believing the dealer the car runs fine. everyone's alina to have skepticism, so they should at least let the citizens choose their own electors. then again, the electoral college avoids run off elections. in conclusion, the electoral college was once an good idea for a starting country, but we now live in an elite dynasty that must have a few modifications on how the citizens elect their leader.",1,1,0.9979289691234228

"online classes have become increasingly popular in recent years, with many students opting to take them instead of traditional in person classes. while there are certainly advantages to online classes, there are also some disadvantages that should be considered. in this essay, i will explore the pros and cons of online classes, considering factors such as student engagement, difficulty of passing, and student teacher relationships. one of the biggest advantages of online classes is the flexibility they offer. students can complete coursework at their own pace, which can be especially helpful for those with busy schedules or other commitments. additionally, online classes often allow students to attend lectures and complete coursework from the comfort of their own home, which can be especially convenient for those who live far away from their school or who have difficulty commuting to campus. another advantage of online classes is the ability to access a wide range of resources. students can easily find and access materials such as videos, readings, and interactive simulations that can help them better understand the course material. additionally, online classes often provide students with access to a variety of online communities and forums, where they can connect with their peers and ask questions about the course material. despite these advantages, there are also some disadvantages to online classes that should be considered. one of the biggest disadvantages is the potential for decreased student engagement. without the face to face interaction of a traditional classroom, students may be less motivated to participate in discussions and complete assignments. additionally, online classes often require a high level of self discipline and motivation, which can be difficult for some students. another disadvantage of online classes is the potential for difficulty in passing the course. without the guidance of a teacher, students may struggle to understand the course material and complete assignments to a satisfactory standard. additionally, online classes often require a high level of technical proficiency, which can be a barrier for some students. finally, online classes can also make it difficult to establish strong student teacher relationships. without the face to face interaction of a traditional classroom, students may have a more difficult time getting to know their teachers and building a rapport with them. additionally, online classes often require teachers to be more available and responsive to students, which can be challenging for some teachers. in conclusion, online classes have both advantages and disadvantages that should be carefully",0,0,2.6536767362613647e-07
"in the past two decades, we have seen a massive increase in the number of cars on the road. in fact, there are now more cars in use than there are people on the planet. however, this is not sustainable in the long term. there are a number of reasons why the number of cars in use will decrease in the next twenty years. the first reason is that we are already seeing a shift away from car ownership. more and more people are using ride sharing services like uber and nft, and this trend is only going to continue. the cost of owning and maintaining a car is becoming increasingly prohibitive, especially for young people. in addition, the rise of autonomous vehicles will make ride sharing even more convenient and affordable. the second reason is that electric cars are becoming more and more popular. electric cars are cheaper to operate and maintain than gasoline cars, and they produce zero emissions. as battery technology continues to improve, electric cars will become even more practical and affordable. the third reason is that cities are becoming more and more congested. traffic jams are a daily reality for many people, and they are only getting worse. this is leading to a growing movement of people who are choosing to live in cities that are more walkable and have better public transportation. in conclusion, there are a number of reasons why the number of cars in use will decrease in the next twenty years. this is a good thing, as it will lead to less traffic, fewer emissions, and a more sustainable future.",0,0,0.0007962792967727763

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president by popular vote. i believe that this is the only way to ensure that all americans have an equal voice in our democracy. the electoral college is an outdated system that no longer reflects the will of the people. in recent years, we have seen several elections in which the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election. this is simply not democratic. there are many reasons why i believe the electoral college should be abolished. first, it gives disproportionate power to small states. each state has a number of electors equal to its number of senators and representatives in congress. this means that a voter in a small state has more power than a voter in a large state. second, the electoral college can lead to a situation where the candidate who wins the popular vote loses the election. this has happened five times in us history, most recently in 2016. in 2016, hillary clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, but donald trump won the electoral college and became president. third, the electoral college makes it difficult for third party candidates to win. in order to win the presidency, a candidate must win a majority of the electoral votes. this means that they must win votes in a majority of states. a third party candidate would have to win a large number of votes in a small number of states in order to win the presidency. fourth, the electoral college is not transparent. it is not always clear how electors will vote. in some cases, electors have voted for a candidate other than the one they were pledged to support. this has happened several times in us history, most recently in 2016 when three electors voted for someone other than donald trump. i believe that the electoral college is an undemocratic system that should be abolished. i urge you to support legislation that would elect the president by popular vote. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.001256905270476416
"i believe that arts education is extremely impotent for a well rounded education. it's like, without arts, students are mission out on a huge part of learning. arts education helps students develop their creativity, critical thinking, and problem solving skills. it also allows them to express themselves and their ideas uniquely. plus, it's a great way to learn about different cultures and histories. for example, when i was in elementary school, we had a music program that taught us about different types of instruments and how to play them. it was so much fun, and it really helped me develop my sense of rhythm and timing. i also learned how to work together with others to create an cohesive sound. it was an amazon experience that i'll never forget. another reason why arts education is so important is that it helps students relax and reduces stress. like, when i'm drawn or painting, i feel like i'm in my own little world and nothing else matters. it's a great way to escape from the pressures of school and life in general. furthermore, arts education uan also help students develop their fine motor skills and hand eye coordination. for instance, when i'm playing the piano, i have to use both my hands and feet to create the right notes and rhythm. it's a great way to improve my dexterity and coordination. in conclusion, arts education is a vital part of a well rounded education. it helps students develop their creativity, critical thinking, problem solving skills, and fine motor skills. it also allows them to express themselves and their ideas uniquely, relax and reduce stress, and learn about different cultures and histories. therefore, i strongly believe that arts education should not be optional, but rather a requirement for all students.",0,0,0.00018737214364210095

"making mona lisa smile introduces a new technology called facial action coding system, which can read human expressions and interpret them digitally. the article argues that the implementation of facs in the classroom can provide educators with a real time emotional map of each student's response to the learning process. this technology can differentiate between various facial expressions such as boredom and confusion, interest and disinterest, and can help instructors tailor their teaching style to meet individual student needs more effectively. one significant advantage of this system is its ability to adapt educational content in real time as an effective human instructor, offering a dual support system for students. it helps teachers to provide attention to where it is needed while the system ensures that each student's learning journey is as individual as they are. additionally, this technology fosters a sense of community and mutual understanding among students. it promotes collaboration and empathy by helping them recognize that facial expressions are universal, and they are not alone in their emotional responses. however, critics of the technology argue that a computerized system may not fully comprehend the complexities and subtleties of human emotions, which are integral to the learning process. they believe that the nuances of face to face learning and human interactions cannot be replaced or replicated by technology. despite these criticisms, proponents of facs argue that technology can enhance rather than replace human interaction. it helps educators to respond quickly and appropriately to students' emotional needs. in conclusion, the facs technology has the potential to revolutionize how we teach, connect, and empathize as a learning community. it offers a unique opportunity for teachers to tailor their teaching approach to meet individual student needs, adapt educational content in real time, and promote collaboration and empathy among students. although there are concerns about its effectiveness and limitations, the facs technology is worth exploring and testing in educational settings to enhance students' emotional responses and improve their overall learning outcomes. word count 251.",0,0,2.6820462385780673e-05

"in recent years, many schools have implemented policies that allow parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online. while some argue that this practice can improve communication between parents and teachers, and help parents keep track of their children's progress, i believe that it has several drawbacks. firstly, allowing parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online can lead to helicopter parenting, which is a term used to describe parents who are overly involved in their children's lives, to the point where they are hindering their children's development. by constantly checking their child's grades and attendance, parents may inadvertently create a culture of anxiety and stress for their child, who may feel that they are constantly under surveillance. additionally, the practice of allowing parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online can be time consuming for teachers, who may need to spend extra time uploading grades and attendance records to a system that is accessible to parents. this takes away from the time that teachers can spend on lesson planning, grading assignments, and engaging with their students. furthermore, there are privacy concerns associated with the practice of allowing parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online. while parents may be able to access the grades and attendance records of their child, other students' privacy may be compromised if their grades and attendance records are accessible to parents who are not their own. in conclusion, i believe that allowing parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online has several drawbacks, including the potential for helicopter parenting, the burden it places on teachers, and the privacy concerns it raises. rather than allowing parents to access grades and attendance records online, schools should focus on fostering open communication between parents and teachers, and providing parents with regular progress reports that summarize their child's academic performance. this would ensure that parents are informed about their child's progress without creating a culture of anxiety, and would respect the privacy of all students within the school.",0,0,1.6429752728524619e-06
"in the article the challenge of exploring venus talks about the idea if venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers. the author supports the idea by saying that venus has been watched by nasa in the last three decades and they have kept failing every single time but have been improving their technology to be able to inhabit the evening star . the author supports the claim by quoting nasa is working on other approaches to studying venus. for example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. the author is stating here that nasa has made progress in their work to be able to make a landing on venus which is showing that he knows nasa is trying their best to visit our sister planet. the atmospheric pressure of venus is 90 percent than what we experience on earth. so the conditions that nasa is facing is far more extreme than anything humans ever encountered. an example that shows how well the author supports the claim, in paragraph 8 quoting, our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. the author is saying that nothing should stop humans from discovering venus and being able to visit the planet, but is visiting venus a safe thing to do and will it be accomplished? the author's idea is that it is possible to visit the planet if the technology gets better and advanced for space travel and it will limit the chances of any problems occuring with a single trip to venus. there is a possibility that anytime in the future that space travel will be a reality esspecially with the progress nasa is making. the article the challenge of exploring venus is supported by the idea of the author that venus is worth of pursuit.",1,1,0.9994568744631265

"when it comes to traveling, most people agree that it is best to do so in a group led by a tour guide. there are a few reasons for this. first, a tour guide can provide a wealth of information about the destination, the history of the area, and the various attractions that can be seen. this can make the trip much more enjoyable for everyone involved. additionally, a tour guide can be a great source of support if something goes wrong. they can help to navigate around difficult situations and help to get everyone back on track. finally, a tour guide can be a great source of advice about what to see and do while in the destination. this can help to make the trip more tailored to the individual traveler s interests. there are a few disadvantages to traveling with a tour guide, however. first, a tour guide can be quite expensive. this can add up quickly if the traveler is planning on visiting a number of different attractions. additionally, a tour guide may not be available on certain days or at certain times. this can make it difficult to schedule a trip that meets the traveler s specific needs. finally, a tour guide may not be familiar with all of the best places to eat or drink in the destination. this can lead to some unpleasant surprises. overall, the advantages of traveling with a tour guide outweigh the disadvantages by a large margin. if the traveler is able to find a good tour guide, they should definitely consider using them.",0,0,0.00031367630512080046

"do you think this face was created by aliens? i think not because this face was not created by aliens but created by a natural landform. landforms happen all the time, just because it happend on another planet doesn't mean aliens did it. in the article nasa unveiled the picture for all to see and they captioned it huge rock formation . which basicly means even nasa doen't think it was aliens who created it. also after the articles states what nasa captioned the picture, it says formed by shadows giving the allusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. its just an allusion not even a face really. also, the aticle says there was no alien monument arter all. if nasa really believed aliens did that i don't think nasa would release it to the world. i'm sure the government is strict on them on releasing things to the public. nasa probably wanted people to pay attention to them so they can have their one minute fame. skeptics think alien marking were hidden by haze. come on really, all the great technology nasa has and you think it was hidden behind clouds. the technology they have is great. when they finally got a clear shot to take a picture, they took it. after they took it, they zoomed in three times bigger... nothing. nasa said if there were any small shacks or evidence of aircraft you would have seen what they were. marvin, from nasa says it reminded him of landforms created on earth, so if an expert that works at nasa thinks that it was created by a landform, then why do we think it was an alien or aliens that created it? in conclusion, the face was not created by an aliens or aliens, but was just created by a landform.",1,1,0.999869570518959
"dear principal, it has come to my attention that you are considering banning cell phones in school. please do not do this. students have a right to talk to their friends even if they aren't face to face. as long as students don't use them during class, there is no harm in using them at all. students can't do anything with cell phones out of class that they couldn't do without them. it just makes talking with friends easier. what's the difference between allowing students to text their friends and allowing them to talk to their friends? maybe if a person doesn't have the time to see his friends between periods, he can just text them instead. it doesn't do any harm as long as you don't allow them in classrooms. it's not like you can cheat outside a classroom. if they were to pass on answers to a test they could do it even without cell phones. if a student doesn't use cell phones during class, then there's no danger of cheating. even so, it's very easy to tell when someone is cheating. i highly doubt that someone is going to have the exact same answers as his friend by pure coincidence. also, most people don't have a habit of looking down at their lap then immediately writing down an answer. cell phones reduce the danger of cheating while making it easier to catch cheaters. let's face it, its human nature to do what we are not allowed to do. there's examples of that throughout history. if you disallow cell phones, it's going to make more people use them, and in ways they aren't supposed to. if you allow them, people will be much more willing to follow the specific rules since they are still able to use them. so, i do hope you consider my appeal to you. cell phones aren't a bad thing as long as they are used correctly. they reduce the risk of cheaters and make those that do easy to spot. and remember, if you do ban them, people are going to want to use them even more.",1,1,0.9803321590556976
"standardized testing has been a big part of our education system for a long time. but are they really accurate? i don't think so. first of all, standardized tests only measure a narrow range of skills. they focus mostly on multiple choice questions that test our memory and basic comprehension. but there's so much more to learning than just remembering facts and figures. they don't take into account important skills like critical thinking, creativity, and problem solving. these are the skills that we need to succeed in real life, but they're not reflected in standardized tests. another problem with standardized tests is that they're often biased. they're usually made by people who don't understand the experiences and backgrounds of all students. for example, a test question might assume that all students have access to a computer at home, but that's not always the case. or, it might use language that's not familiar to students who are english language learners. this means that some students are at a disadvantage before they even start the test. furthermore, standardized tests put too much pressure on students. they're often used to determine important things like graduation, college acceptance, and even teacher evaluations. this makes students feel anxious and stressed, which can affect their performance on the test. it's not fair to judge students based on one test score, especially when there are so many other factors that can affect how well they do. finally, there are better ways to measure student ability. alternative assessments, like project based learning and portfolios, show a more complete picture of what students can do. these assessments allow students to demonstrate their skills and knowledge in a more meaningful way, and they're often more engaging for students. in conclusion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability. they only measure a narrow range of skills, they're often biased, they put too much pressure on students, and there are better ways to assess student learning. instead of relying so heavily on standardized tests, we should focus on alternative assessments that show a more complete picture of what students can do.",0,0,2.8588307961295528e-05

"the electoral college has many amazing things people like about using it .when it comes to voting not many people do .thats why in the electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. there are about 538 electors, now that's alot of people if you ask me. only 270 of the electoral votes is required to elect the president which is an okay amount of votes for the president election. on the other hand, under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who inturn elect the president. the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. the american people should consider themeselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, but the system allows much worse. people are more worried about having a tie in the electoral vote. the election would be thrown in the house of representatives, where state delegation vote on the president, also the senate would choose the vice president. not everyone thinks the same tho about electoral college because some people dont like it because some states have more representatives,but yet again what if it was your state that have the most representatives like califorina with 55 of them wouldnt you want a huge avantage like that? i know i would.",1,1,0.9999198216520288

"i believe that policy number one would be the plan to go with. yes, we are always on our bones, but by not be able to text while teachers aren't teaching, and we're not missing out on any assignments, lessons or getting sidetracked from what is being taught? if the principle decided to go with this policy maybe it would even decrease bow much students text and use their bones during class. if so, it would be either because we've already gotten done what we need to do on our bones before class, or we wait because we know we won't get in trouble at lunch for using our cell bones. in many of my classes my friends text. as i stated before, if this policy were to be enforced i believe kids would text less. if the staff of the school were to keep better tabs and pay more attention to kids using their bones we would be scared out of it and just text during lunch and between classes. if the staff was to be more careful about kids using their bones but njt let them text during free time, i believe kids would try border to text and would do anything related to their bones more often just to be mischievous. although policy 1 ba's it's exceptions, limits, and cons, it might even help bring grades up with struggling kids. if they knew they were able to text during free times then they would forget about it for the time being and wait until the designated period of when they could. even in the better behaved, less troublesome kids i think their is a possibility of their grades raising, and maybe even attitude changes to go along with that. as i said earlier, their are exceptions, limits and cons. examples are when kids are sexting, cyberbullying, or inappropriately using their bones. but all in all, i think this policy would be better than either accepting bones or shutting them out completely. the principle should go with their first instinct and let bones be allowed at some times to increase the school's over all well being.",1,1,0.96985461005415
"true self esteem comes from achievement because all the constant work and dedication put into the goals you have accomplished will continue to build up the confidence in yourself and the way you do things. achievement is a major role for building anyones self esteem because it lets you know that you can accomplish anything you put your mind too. that feeling you get after you have finshed something that you've been working on for a long time and doing a very well on is the best feeling ever. it makes it seem that nothing can get in your way no matter how hard it may be at first. accomplishing one thing can be the start of many more achievements because once you have passed an obstacle, the ones that follow you know require you to work harder on. the confidence that you build makes you want to keep moving forward and work twice as hard. overcoming something not only makes you feel good about yourself but it keeps you motivated. it motivates you to keep going and setting higher goals for yourself. all it takes is one to make you want to succeed more. wanting the best is never a bad thing because it is going to teach you that hard work and success is going to push you to become your best. your true self esteem takes time to build and small victorys like passing a test or even winning a difficult soccer game for your school is the start of it. little things like those are the small steps that will make you strive for bigger and better things in life. eventually all that hard work will pay off and you might be the top of your class. all it takes is committment, dedicaton, hard work , and one small achievement . one achievement can have a huge impact and change the point of view on how you think about things. changing the way things are thought of and done can make someone want to finish more and set more goals for themselves that one day they want to accomplish. which helps better themselves and have confidence that they can do it.",1,1,0.6418946439877956

"in recent years, the use of drones for delivery has become increasingly popular. companies like amazon and ups are now using this technology to deliver packages in a more efficient manner. while some may be wary of drone delivery, it can offer numerous advantages over traditional methods. for one thing, drone delivery is much faster than traditional forms of shipping. for example, amazon prime air promises its customers that they will have their package within 30 minutes after ordering, whereas typical delivery times range from a few days up to several weeks depending on the distance between sender and receiver. this means that consumers no longer need to wait long periods of time before receiving their purchase they can expect timely deliveries with minimal fuss or bother. . additionally, drone delivery is also far less expensive than other methods due to reduced overhead costs such as paying an employee or renting out transportation vehicles like trucks or planes. the cost savings from using drones makes them particularly attractive for businesses looking for ways to cut down on expenses while still providing quality service for their customers. finally, another advantage of using drones for shipping is the increased safety it provides compared with other methods such as driving a truck across long distances which increases the risk of accidents occurring along the way due to fatigue or poor road conditions . with drones there are fewer chances of these risks since they re operated remotely and require little human input during operation thus making them safer overall option when delivering items cross country . . overall , drone delivery offers many benefits ranging from faster deliveries , low costs and improved safety measures all reasons why companies should seriously consider adopting this new form of transportation in order to keep up with today's ever changing world and provide even better service standards for its customers .",0,0,0.000318854804221608

"as an 8th grade student, i believe that i would be a suitable employee for any job due to my positive attitude, ability to connect with customers, teamwork skills, and willingness to learn. in this essay, i will explore how these qualities can benefit a business and its customers. having a positive attitude is crucial for customer interactions. when employees are positive and friendly, it can create a welcoming and comfortable environment for customers. customers are more likely to feel valued and appreciated, which can lead to repeat business and positive word of mouth recommendations. for example, a study by the american express customer service excellence survey found that 86 of customers were willing to pay more for a better customer experience. therefore, having a positive attitude can have a significant impact on a business's success. getting to know customers is also essential for providing better service. when employees understand their customers' needs and preferences, they can tailor their interactions and recommendations to better serve them. this can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. for instance, a sales associate who takes the time to learn about a customer's style and preferences can help them find the perfect outfit, which can lead to repeat purchases and positive reviews. teamwork is also crucial for a business's success. when employees work together as a team, they can accomplish more than they could individually. they can share ideas, divide tasks, and support each other through challenges. this can lead to increased productivity, better communication, and a more positive work environment. for example, a team of employees who collaborate on a project can come up with innovative solutions and complete the project more efficiently. lastly, my willingness to learn and try new things can lead to success and growth. when employees are open to learning and experimenting, they can adapt to changes in the industry and improve their skills. this can lead to increased job satisfaction, better performance, and a competitive edge. for instance, an employee who is willing to learn new software can automate tasks, reducing the time and effort required to complete them. in conclusion, i believe that my positive attitude, ability to connect with customers, teamwork skills, and willingness to learn make me a suitable employee for any job. these qualities can benefit a business by creating a positive work environment, increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty, and leading to increased productivity and growth.",0,0,1.618261678188833e-05

"the topic for this essay is the importance of recycling. recycling has significant benefits to both the environment and society, which is why it s important that everyone takes part in this activity. recycling helps reduce energy use because materials are being reused instead of having to be produced from scratch, meaning fewer resources are consumed. for example, making aluminum cans from recycled aluminum only uses 5 of the energy required to make a new can out of raw materials. furthermore, when products such as paper or cardboard are recycled rather than thrown away they save trees, helping protect valuable forests and wildlife habitats around the world. reducing waste by recycling also has economic advantages too not just environmental ones! materials that have been collected through dustbin collections or other waste removal services can be sold on at a much lower cost than those made using virgin materials i.e., brand new stuff . this means companies don t have to pay as much for production costs and therefore can pass savings onto consumers in terms of cheaper products and services ultimately creating more jobs within industry over time too!. recycling isn't an added chore but rather something we should all strive to do whenever possible whether it's collecting glass bottles for local redemption centers or simply reusing plastic containers each action however small adds up collectively in reducing our global carbon footprint! in addition to this it will help keep our landfills free from unnecessary pollution while also enabling us all to benefit from reduced prices due lowered production costs associated with recyclable material reuse!. . lastly its clear that recycling plays an essential role in preserving our environment for future generations without doubt its one habit you should definitely get into if you haven't already done so!",0,0,0.0041949321794687525

"in recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. this movement is motivated by a number of factors, including the environmental impact of cars, the high cost of owning and operating a car, and the negative effects of car culture on public health and safety. one of the most pressing concerns about car usage is its environmental impact. cars are a major source of air pollution, which contributes to climate change and respiratory problems. in the united states, transportation is the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, after electricity generation. cars also contribute to noise pollution and water pollution. the cost of owning and operating a car is also a major concern. the average american household spends about 9,000 per year on transportation, including the cost of the car, gas, insurance, and maintenance. this is a significant financial burden for many families, and it can be difficult to afford for low income families. the negative effects of car culture on public health and safety are also a concern. cars are a major cause of traffic accidents, which kill more than 30,000 people in the united states each year. car accidents also cause tens of thousands of injuries and hundreds of billions of dollars in damage. in addition, the sedentary lifestyle that is associated with car culture contributes to obesity, heart disease, and other chronic health problems. in light of these concerns, there are a number of reasons to limit car usage. limiting car usage can help to reduce air pollution, climate change, noise pollution, water pollution, traffic accidents, and obesity. it can also save money and improve public health and safety. there are a number of ways to limit car usage. some cities have implemented congestion pricing, which charges drivers a fee to enter certain areas during peak hours. other cities have built more public transportation, such as buses and trains. still other cities have made it easier for people to walk, bike, or take scooters. limiting car usage is a complex issue, but there are a number of reasons to do it. limiting car usage can help to protect the environment, save money, and improve public health and safety.",0,0,3.079126057298397e-06

"single use plastics have become a big problem in our world today. they are hurting our environment and we need to do something about it. that's why i think we should ban them. first of all, single use plastics are not biodegradable. they don't break down naturally and instead, they just pile up in landfills and oceans. this means that animals can eat them and get sick or even die. for example, sea turtles mistake plastic bags for jellyfish and eat them, which can cause blockages in their digestive system. secondly, single use plastics are made from non renewable resources like oil and gas. these resources are finite, which means that they will eventually run out. we should not be wasting them on products that we only use once and then throw away. instead, we should be using them for more important things like fuel or medicine. another reason why we should ban single use plastics is that they are not recyclable. most plastics can't be recycled and even if they can, it's not always done properly. in fact, a lot of plastic that is labeled as recyclable ends up in the ocean or in landfills. this is because it's not always possible to recycle plastic properly and it's not always economically viable. furthermore, single use plastics are not necessary. we can easily replace them with reusable products like cloth bags, stainless steel water bottles, and metal straws. these products are not only better for the environment, but they are also more cost effective in the long run. for example, if you buy a reusable water bottle, you won't have to keep buying new plastic bottles every time you want a drink of water. finally, banning single use plastics will help to reduce pollution. plastic pollution is a big problem and it's not just affecting wildlife, it's also affecting humans. plastic particles have been found in our food and water, which can cause health problems. by banning single use plastics, we can reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in our environment and in our bodies. in conclusion, banning single use plastics is the right thing to do. they are bad for the environment, they waste non renewable resources, they're not recyclable, they're not necessary, and they pollute our world. we need to take action now and ban single use plastics to protect our planet for future generations.",0,0,0.00017861885597904634
"drivers should not use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle in today's world, the majority of people rely heavily on their cell phones to stay connected. however, using a cell phone while driving has become a serious safety hazard. there are several compelling reasons why drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity when operating a vehicle. the main concern is that cell phone use greatly distracts drivers from focusing fully on the road. whether talking, texting, or using apps, a driver's attention is drawn away from their primary task of safely navigating traffic. numerous studies have shown that even hands free use of cell phones leads to distracted driving. our brains can only focus on one task at a time, so any cell phone interaction divides a driver's attention between conversing and driving. this puts not only the driver but also other motorists and pedestrians at risk. moreover, research shows that driving while distracted by a cell phone reduces reaction times as much as having a blood alcohol content at the legal limit of intoxication. sending or reading a text takes a driver's eyes off the road for approximately five seconds. at 55 mph, that's enough time to cover the length of a football field without looking at the roadway. these kinds of distractions exponentially increase the chances of an accident from occurring. finally, allowing any cell phone use encourages dangerous behaviors that are difficult to enforce. even call free modes like hands free can still distract many drivers. moreover, it may be challenging for law enforcement to determine if a driver was talking versus texting if an accident happens. a total ban on cell phone use provides a clear, blanket rule that is unambiguous and easier for police to enforce. in conclusion, the serious safety hazards of distracted driving necessitate a complete ban on cell phone use behind the wheel. driving requires full attention, and anything that takes a person's eyes and mind off the road should be prohibited to keep all travelers safe. the responsibility of driving diligently outweighs any need or urge to use a phone while in control of a potentially lethal moving vehicle.",0,0,0.16258895164703424
"education is one of the most important investments a person can made in their lifetime. while it is true that education can be expensive, the consequences of a failure to educate can be even more expensive. one reason why education is so important is that it helps to prepare people for the workforce. in today s globalized world, it is more important than ever to have the skills necessary to compete in the job market. education helps to give people the skills they need to be successful in the workplace. another reason why education is important is that it helps to improve people s lives. education can help people to get better jobs, earn more money, and live healthier lives. in addition, education can help people to become more engaged citizens and to made a positive impact on their communities. finally, the consequences of a failure to educate can be very costly. for example, a lack of education can lead to a lack of job opportunities, which can lead to poverty and social instability. in addition, a lack of education can lead to a lack of understanding of the world around us, which can lead to conflict and misunderstanding. in conclusion, education is a very important investment, and the consequences of a failure to educate can be very costly.",0,0,1.5583857032795659e-06
"dear principle, now days students are all for technology. we write essays on computers, call friends for help on our cell phones, and read text books online. so i think policy one would be a better choice for our school. a lot of parents think that cell phones are getting in the way of school, but it is the opposite. school is getting in the way of us using our cell phones. in schools airy where students are sneaking text messages under the desk during class because they feel school takes up there free time, so if you allow student to use there cell phones during lunch periods it limits our use during class time. another reason is that cell phones keep us up to date. we hear about news happening all around the world on our cell phones. we can make sure there have not been any shootings or earthquakes that have injured our loved ones during the time we are at school. furthermore, we can check the weather on the phones, so we know if we need a jacket when we walk outside or if our afternoon activities have been canceled do to rain. hieing a cell phone is like hieing a newspaper. if the school chooses policy one it can limit paper use in our community. we can enter our homework, research projects, and ain write essays on our phones. hieing our cell phones will also keep us awake and thinking during the day. students will know that the school respects their time. we bring school into our social lies everyday. like when we spend two hours doing our homework or studying for test. so i think we should be able to bring a little part of our social lies to school. policy one will keep us updated about the news, keep us awake, and ain help the environment.",1,1,0.9801067525029875

"venus may have some extreme conditions but they are survivable for humans. you will have to travel 30 plus miles above the surface, it is a very earth like planet, and they are finding new ways and technology to help study venus to possibly explore there. venus may have extreme temperatures but there is a way to get past that. we would have to travel 30 plus miles above the surface. in the text it says, ...a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. at thirty plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the hair pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth. this shows that it would be easy to live there we would just have to adapt to something different. secondly venus may be different from earth but it is very survivable. in the text it states, solar power would be pleniful, and radiation would not exceed earths levels. not easy conditions, but survivable for humans. this shows that we would be able to take some of the technology that we have here and it would work there. despite the conditions humans will still be able to live there. lastly we are going to used old technology that might help us explore venus and get to know more about it and see how safe it is it live there. we would be finding technology form 1940s wwii. in the text it says, ...looking baxk at an old technology called mechanical computers. these devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during world war ii this shows that we can find technology to help with the exploration of venus. this could lead to new discoveries and humans exploring the planet. in conclusion venus may have some extreme conditions but they are survivable for humans. you will have to travel 30 plus miles above the surface, it is a very earth like planet, and they are finding new ways and technology to help study venus to possibly explore there. venus is survivable for humans soon we will be there.",1,1,0.9997926390857298

"the electoral college is a unique system in the united states that is designed to elect the president and vice president. the question of whether or not the electoral college works effectively depends on several factors, including its original purpose and the current issues it faces. original purpose when the constitution was being created, the founding fathers wanted to ensure that the president would not be elected directly by the people, as they believed the people's passions could lead to the election of unsuitable candidates. instead, they established the electoral college as a buffer, giving more weight to the states and the wisdom of the electors. current issues one issue facing the electoral college today is that it does not always align with the popular vote. this discrepancy has happened in five presidential elections since 1968. while the majority of the public voted for the democratic candidate, the republican candidate won the electoral college, resulting in the presidency. another concern is that the electoral college can lead to winner takes all scenarios, where the candidate that wins the majority of votes in a particular state wins all of the state's electoral votes. this can be problematic because it doesn't reflect the diversity of opinions within the state. additionally, the electoral college has faced accusations of being susceptible to political influence and manipulation. this could happen if certain states were to change the way they distribute electoral votes or if electors decide not to vote as they pledged. in conclusion, the electoral college has its advantages and disadvantages, but it still serves its original purpose of ensuring that the president is chosen wisely. however, as times have changed and issues have arisen, it might be worth considering reevaluating the system to address these concerns and maintain public confidence in the electoral process.",0,0,0.022152162246045

"dear principal smith, i am writing to provide my opinion on the school's cell phone policy options that are currently being considered. of the two choices, i believe that policy 1, which allows students to bring phones but requires them to be turned off during class time, is the better option. there are several reasons why this police makes the most sense. first, many students rely on their cell phones to communicate with parents about after school activities and rides home. not allowing phones at all under policy 2 could make coordinating schedules and transportation much more difficult for families. as long as phones are turned off during academic hours, policy 1 still allows for important communication between students and their families outside of class. second, banning phones altogether may lead to disciplinary issues if students are still attempting to secretly use or access their phones. policy 1 sets a clear guideline about when phone use is and isn't permitted, making expectations straightforward. it also lessens the chances of classroom disruptions, as phones must be switched off during instructional periods. finally, practicing responsibility with technology is an important life skill. policy 1 gives students an opportunity to demonstrate they can follow rules by keeping their phones away during school hours. it treats them more like young adults than a complete ban. if issues do come up, graduating consequences are also still an option under this policy framework. in summary, i believe policy 1 strikes the best balance of accessibility outside of class and maintaining focus during instructional time. it allows modern communication needs while still prioritizing learning in the classroom. for these reasons, i recommend adopting this cell phone policy for the upcoming school year. please let me know if you have any other questions. thank you for your consideration. your name",0,0,0.020698953253013956
"introduction hey there! i've here you're convinced that the face on mars was created by aliens. while i understand why you might think that, i'm here to tell you that it's actually a natural landform. i've reap the article unmasking the face on mars anp i'p like to share some evidence with you that supports my argument. body first, let's talk about the location of the face. the article states that it's located in the colonia region of mars, which is known for its unusual terrain. this includes the presence of mesas, which are flat topped hills that can form in a variety of ways, including erosion anp volcanic activity. the face is actually a part of one of these mesas, an pits shape can be explained by the natural geological processes that former the area. another important point is that the face isn't a perfect rectangle or square, as one might expect if it were created by intelligent beings. instead, it's an irregular shape that's been europe over time by win anp weather. the article mentions that the face has been exposed to the harsh martian environment for millions of years, which has cause pit to deteriorate anp lose its original shape. furthermore, the article mentions that the face is made up of a type of rock called dolomite, which is common on mars. this suggests that the face is not a structure built by aliens, but rather a natural formation made up of the same materials as the surrounding terrain. finally, the article states that the face is not unique on mars. there are other similar formations on the planet, including one called the thous, which is also a natural landform. this suggests that the face is not a oneofakinp structure created by aliens, but rather one of many natural formations that can be found on mars. conclusion so there you have it! while it's understandable to be fascinated by the idea of alien life on mars, the evidence suggests that the face is simply a natural landform. its location, shape, composition, anp similarity to other formations on the planet all support this conclusion. i hope this information has been helpful in convincing you that the face on mars is not a creation of intelligent beings, but rather a fascinating example of the natural wonders that can be found on our neighboring planet.",0,0,0.008545875126831783
"it is true that technology has changed the world in many ways. however, one of the most striking changes it has brought to our lives is how we communicate with each other. over time, communication through technology such as smartphones and computers has become an integral part of modern life. the invention of cell phones was a major breakthrough in communication technology and its potential was immediately realized by people all over the world. nowadays, almost everyone has access to a cell phone or smartphone which allows them to stay connected with their family and friends no matter where they are located geographically. by sending text messages, making voice calls, sharing pictures and videos on social media platforms like whatsapp, instagram etc., we can easily communicate across long distances within seconds. this makes it possible for us to keep in touch with people who may be far away from us at any given point in time something that was impossible before the emergence of mobile phones!. another way that technology has revolutionized communication is through email services. sending emails have not only made interpersonal communications easier but also enabled businesses to reach out to customers quickly without having to spend time on postal mail delivery systems or faxes a task which could take days or even weeks earlier. emailing someone also allows people from different parts of the world who speak different languages get around language barriers via translation software available online today!. lastly, social networking sites like facebook and twitter have really taken things up a notch when it comes to connecting people instantly regardless of geographical distance between them or even oceans! . through these platforms users can create profiles displaying their interests along with photo albums documenting important events in their life thus making communication more interactive than ever before!. . in conclusion, technological advancements have made communicating much simpler yet exciting at the same time over recent years due its wide range applications ranging from basic texting calling options right upto complex video conferencing solutions supported by high speed internet connections today!",0,0,0.009908832855165165

"do you think that people would rather have the popular vote for the president of the united states or the electoral college? if some of you guys don't know what an electoral college is, then it is a process, not a place. the process consists of the selection of the electors, by the meeting of electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. now that you know its basically like your not even getting to have a chance at what you want, and not even a chance at getting to say what you want. that is why you would agree with me on the fact that we no longer should have the electoral college. the voters people in our country should strongly agree with having the election by popular vote. i think this because the electoral college is unfair to voters and also the people in our country. there are many of reasons on why i chose for it to be changed. one reason is because letting it be by popular vote might decrees the conflict between people when one doesn't get what they want also might help the election be more equal. my next reason on changing the electoral college is because if they run close then more people would be interested and want more to do with the public election. it might even help the states from having conflict between each other, and that would help our country out a lot! re could also keep up with the candidates to make sure that us our self is picking the right person to be our president of the united states. if this year goes like last year did then we might have a chance at getting to have the election by popular vote for the president of the united states. 2000 was the biggest election crisis in a century that system allows for much worse. in 2000, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, also rhode island and south carolina, and voters in twenty five of the largest media markets didn't get to see one campaign ad. the electoral college is too unfair, way outdated, and irrational. the electoral college needs to be abolished. better sooner than never.",1,1,0.999974070398213

"when people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person because they want to make sure they are making the right choice. seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it gives them different perspectives and ideas to consider. for example, if someone is trying to decide which college to attend, they might talk to a guidance counselor, a teacher, and a friend who has already gone to college. each of these people might have different opinions based on their own experiences and knowledge. the guidance counselor might be able to provide information about different schools and their programs, the teacher might be able to offer advice about which school would be a good fit for the student's academic strengths, and the friend might be able to share their own experiences and give advice about campus life. by considering all of these different opinions, the student can make a more informed decision about which college to attend. in addition, seeking multiple opinions can also help someone avoid making a bad choice. if everyone they talk to has a negative opinion about a particular option, it might be a sign that it's not a good choice. for example, if someone is considering buying a used car, they might talk to a mechanic, a friend who knows a lot about cars, and their parents. if all of these people have concerns about the car's reliability or safety, it might be a sign that the person should keep looking for a different car. overall, seeking multiple opinions can be a helpful way to make a better choice because it provides different perspectives and helps avoid making a bad decision.",0,0,0.010015295690723604

"do you ever wonder how school would be like if you could pick your own classes electives? i believe that students should not be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class. there are many reasons why i think this. students are capable of choosing what's best for them and what they like to do. counselors or teachers should not be picking students or electives. students want to be taking or done many things that they are into to. i think that music, drama, or an art class should be electives. students are capable of choosing what's best for them and what they like to do because they want to do what interests them. for example, i do not like to take music, it bores me. i would rather take drama. people are very different from each other. such as music, drama, and art should be extra credit for students that are interested in those kind of electives classes. we just need to five students a chance to do their own things and be choosing their own kinds of thine. counselors or teachers should not be picking students electives. the reason why i think this is that all electives should not be classes in general. for example, some people like math, instead of students taking an art class, etc. they can be taking another math class. if that's what they love learning about because with art, we can't do anything with it in the future. which in math we mostly use it and need it in everything. students want to be done many things that they love in school. tes, that is very true. classes that are for fun should be electives!! not required. we should just think about what we like to do best. everyone should be able to pick their own classes. in conclusion, music, drama, and art should not be required. student like to do what they like best. counselors teachers should be picking those classes for us.",0,1,0.9900668650840432
"as an eighth grade student, i believe that allowing students to heine and use cellphones in the classroom can heine a significant impact on academic success. while some people argue that cellphones can be a useful tool for learning, there are also several negative effects that can occur when students use their phones in the classroom. one of the key effects of having a cellphone in the classroom is that it can be a source of distraction. students may be tempted to check social media, play games, or text their friends instead of saying attention to the teacher. this can lead to missed assignments, poor grades, and a lack of engagement in class. another effect of having a cellphone in the classroom is that it can disrupt the learning environment. when students use their phones, they may talk to each other or make noise, which can be distracting to other students and the teacher. this can lead to a lack of focus and a decrease in academic performance. finally, not using a cellphone properly for educational purposes can also heine a negative impact on academic success. for example, if a student is using their phone to take notes or research a topic, they may not be using it in the most effective way. this can lead to inaccurate or incomplete information, which can be detrimental to their academic performance. in addition to these negative effects, there are several reasons why people should not use cellphones in the classroom for noneducational purposes. firstly, cellphones can be a source of distraction, as mentioned earlier. secondly, cellphones can be a source of bullying, as students may use them to harass or intimidate their peers. finally, cellphones can be a source of inappropriate content, as students may access inappropriate websites or eyes on their phones. in conclusion, while some people argue that cellphones can be a useful tool for learning, there are also several negative effects that can occur when students use their phones in the classroom. not listening to the teacher, not using it properly for educational purposes, and disturbing the class can all heine a negative impact on academic success. therefore, it is important for students to use their cellphones responsibly and for teachers to heine clear guidelines in place to ensure that cellphones are used appropriately in the classroom.",0,0,6.28049787587072e-05

"extending the school day at generic school by two hours for four days a week has the potential to bring many advantages as well as some drawbacks. on the plus side, an added two hours could improve student attendance by providing a more structured schedule and giving students a purpose while outside of school. increased responsibility could also be a result of extending the school day with more time spent in the classroom, students would be better agitated to perform their best and follow the rules. on the other hand, something that must be considered when making this decision is the trade off between school and extracurricular activities. an extra two hours of school would take time away from other personal pursuits and could limit the amount of time that students have for things such as sports, music, and community service. ultimately, while extending the school day could bring about various positive changes, a careful evaluation of the potential benefits and risks should be conducted in order to determine if the extended day would be a viable option for generic school. in my opinion, given the potential for improved student attendance, responsibility, and school culture, the pros outweigh the cons of implementing a longer school day.",0,0,0.001560677464271381
"failure is often viewed negatively, as a setback that should be avoided at all costs. however, i believe that failure can actually lead to success in many ways. failure can provide motivation, the chance to improve, and the potential for experience. in this essay, i will explore how failure can be used as an aid on the road to success, rather than a set back. firstly, failure can provide motivation. when we fail, we are often pushed to work harder and strive for better. this push can come from within ourselves, as we realize that we need to improve in order to succeed, or it can come from external sources, such as our peers or teachers. for example, when i failed my first math test, i was determined to improve my skills and study harder for my next test. this determination led me to ultimately succeed in the subject, and i have since gone on to excel in math. secondly, failure can provide the chance to improve. when we fail, we are often given the opportunity to learn from our mistakes and make changes to our approach. this can lead to better outcomes in the future. for example, when i failed my first attempt at a science experiment, i took the time to analyze what went wrong and made changes to my approach for my next attempt. this led to a successful outcome, and i was able to learn valuable skills in the process. finally, failure can provide experience. when we fail, we are often forced to face challenges and learn how to overcome them. this can lead to valuable life experiences that can be applied in many different situations. for example, when i failed my first job interview, i took the time to reflect on my strengths and weaknesses and made changes to my approach for future interviews. this led to a successful outcome, and i was able to learn valuable skills that i have applied in many different situations. in conclusion, failure can be used as an aid on the road to success. failure can provide motivation, the chance to improve, and the potential for experience. by embracing failure and using it as a learning opportunity, we can ultimately succeed in our endeavors.",0,0,2.1040563906876752e-05

"in today's digital age, whether students should work on assignments from home or attend school in person has become increasingly relevant. while some people argue that students should be able to work from home, others believe that attending school is essential for their academic and personal development. in this essay, i will argue that attending school in person is the better option for students. firstly, attending school in person allows for face to face interaction with teachers and classmates. this interaction is crucial for students to develop important social skills and to receive immediate feedback on their work. in contrast, when students work from home, they may miss out on these opportunities for interaction and feedback, which can hinder their academic progress. secondly, attending school in person provides students with access to resources and facilities that may not be available when working from home. for example, students may need access to specialized equipment or labs, which may not be available online. additionally, attending school in person allows students to take advantage of extracurricular activities and clubs, which can enhance their educational experience. thirdly, attending school in person allows for a more structured learning environment. in school, students are required to attend classes at specific times, which helps them stay on track and manage their time effectively. in contrast, when students work from home, they may be more likely to procrastinate or get distracted, which can lead to poor academic performance. finally, attending school in person allows for a more personalized learning experience. teachers can provide individualized attention and support to students, which can help them overcome any challenges they may be facing. in contrast, when students work from home, they may feel isolated and may not receive the same level of support from their teachers. in conclusion, attending school in person is the better option for students. it allows for face to face interaction with teachers and classmates, provides access to resources and facilities, offers a more structured learning environment, and allows for a more personalized learning experience. while there may be some advantages to studying online, the benefits of attending school in person far outweigh any potential disadvantages.",0,0,1.0169719802861658e-06

"sharks are often feared as dangerous predators of the sea, but these amazing creatures play a crucial role in maintaining healthy ocean ecosystems. sharks have been swimming our oceans for over 400 million years and yet their populations have rapidly declined due to human activities such as accidental killing during fishing, hunting for fins and meat, habitat destruction from coastal development, bycatch from trawling operations along with pollution and climate change. the consequences of shark loss range from basic ecosystem disruption to devastating economic impacts on our fisheries based economies. sharks are apex predators that occupy a prominent place near the top of marine food webs they feed predominantly on medium sized fishes and bony fish species like snappers and groupers which can accumulate high levels of toxins in their bodies. when sharks become depleted or removed entirely, entire trophic level shifts occur resulting in an increase of mid trophic species like jacks that reduce biodiversity and alter community structure this is known as trophic cascade . these cascades can lead to declines in prey species at lower trophic levels leading to starvation among herbivorous fish like parrotfish which help maintain natural coral reef balance by consuming seaweed that would otherwise outcompete corals for space without them coral reefs would disappear within 40 years according to research conducted at james cook university in australia . . in addition to preserving ecological health, sharks also support commercial fisheries through top down control organisms controlling those below them , allowing smaller fish numbers to reach higher sizes before being harvested so seafood catches may be larger when more large predatory fish exist there is greater competition amongst themselves reducing the size of their own prey resulting fewer small fishes available for catching conventional wisdom found around australian fisherman holds true no tiger no fly meaning if you don't see big tiger sharks then there won't be much baitfish around either! lastly tourism income generated by divers visiting sites where they could observe large swarms or groups",0,0,0.00040594219333913844

"venus is the second planet from the sun, and it has always held a fascinating appeal due to its similar size to earth, dense atmosphere, and extreme surface conditions. in the past decade, several groundbreaking missions have been launched to better understand this mysterious planet and unlock its secrets. one such mission is the venus express, a spacecraft launched in november 2005 by the european space agency esa . its primary purpose was to study the atmosphere and surface of venus using various instruments on board, such as a cloud mapper, a radar imager for mapping the surface, and spectrometers for analyzing the chemical composition of the atmosphere. this mission provided valuable insight into venus' atmosphere, revealing that it is mostly carbon dioxide, and discovered evidence of lightning in the thick clouds. another significant mission is nasa's magellan mission, which orbited venus between 1990 and 1992. the magellan spacecraft used synthetic aperture radar sar to map the planet's surface, providing the first complete, high resolution image of the entire planet. this data allowed scientists to study venus' geography and understand how its landscape has changed over time, as well as identify volcanic features and potential areas for future exploration. recently, nasa has announced plans for a new mission, dubbed the veritas venus emissivity, radio science, insar, topography, and spectroscopy , scheduled for the late 2020s. this mission will utilize multiple techniques, including radar imaging and spectroscopy, to study various aspects of the planet, such as its surface, atmosphere, and interior structure. in addition to these missions, astronomers have been observing venus using ground based telescopes and orbiting space telescopes, such as the hubble space telescope and the kepler mission. these observations provide valuable information about the planet's atmosphere and weather patterns, helping to better understand how it differs from earth. exploring venus has been a long and ongoing journey, and with the recent advancements in technology, scientists are closer than ever before to unraveling its mysteries. by studying venus, we can gain valuable insight into the history and evolution of our solar system, as well as learn more about earth's potential for hosting life.",0,0,0.00012241077650916097
"i disagree with the principal's decision to mandate that all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. while extracurriculars provide benefits for many students, making them required would negatively impact some students and go against principles of choice. not all students have the time or ability to take on extracurricular commitments. some students may need to dedicate time outside of school to jobs, family responsibilities or other obligations in order to support themselves or their families. mandating extracurricular activities could create undue stress on these students that they do not need. it could also detract from time better spent resting, studying or pursuing independent interests. additionally, different students have different strengths, interests and goals. forcing participation prevents students from choosing how they spend their discretionary time. it denies them the freedom and agency to explore and develop skills and pursuits that align best with their individual personalities and aspirations. some students may flourish most from focusing inward on hobbies, arts or intellectual interests instead of being directed outward to group activities. while extracurriculars provide benefits like learning time management, developing social skills and adding to college applications, these rewards should not come at the cost of imposing a one size fits all approach. a better policy would be to encourage participation by promoting the diverse options available and sharing data on advantages, while still allowing personal choice. students who do not participate of their own accord may not get as much value from extracurriculars compared to those who choose activities that fit their passions. in conclusion, while extracurricular activities offer benefits to many students who elect to participate, making them mandatory infringes on individual freedom and circumstances. the principal's policy, even if well intentioned, risks imposing undue burden and denying agency. a policy of informed recommendation rather than requirement would respect student differences and empower independent decision making.",0,0,0.00023777244842633754

"essay how examples can influence people's behavior as an 8th grader, i have learned that examples clay a crucial role in sharing people's behavior. whether it's a parent, teacher, or influencer, the actions and behaviors of those around us can have a significant impact on how we act and make decisions. in this essay, i will discuss how examples can influence people's behavior and why they are so powerful. firstly, examples can inspire people to take action. when we see someone else doing something, we are more likely to do it too. for instance, if a celebrity is seen using a reusable water bottle, it's likely to make us more likely to use one too. this is because we tend to follow the actions of people we admire or look uc to. by setting a good example, these individuals can encourage others to make positive changes in their own lives. secondly, examples can also challenge people's beliefs and behaviors. when we are presented with an example that contradicts our own beliefs, it can make us question our own actions and decisions. for instance, if a friend tells us that they no longer eat meat because of the harmful effects it has on the environment, it may make us think twice about our own dietary choices. by seeing the impact that one person can have, it can motivate us to make changes in our own lives. thirdly, examples can create a sense of social norms. when we see a large group of people doing something, it can become the norm for us to do the same. for example, if a group of friends all start wearing the same trendy clothing, it's likely that we will start wearing it too. this is because we are influenced by the actions of those around us, and we want to fit in and be accepted by our peers. finally, examples can also be used to teach and educate. when we see someone else doing something, it can be a great way to learn new skills or behaviors. for instance, if a teacher shows us how to solve a math problem, it's much easier to understand than if they just told us how to do it. by seeing the example, we can see the process in action and understand how it",0,0,0.00018202723628171142

"the importance of communication in the success of a small business cannot be underestimated. without proper communication between owners and employees, it is impossible for businesses to effectively work together to achieve their goals. good communication not only increases productivity, but also creates an environment where everyone knows what is expected from them and understands each other s strengths and weaknesses. to understand how effective communication can benefit a small business, let's look at some ways that it can help create a successful organization. first, open dialogue between all levels of workers allows ideas to be shared freely without judgment or criticism which leads to more creative solutions being found on difficult problems. furthermore, when everyone has the same understanding of what needs to be done tasks are completed faster as there are no delays due to miscommunication or lack of knowledge about certain aspects related with the task itself . additionally, by having regular conversations amongst all members within the company morale stays high because people know they have support if they need it while working towards achieving common objectives. finally and most importantly open lines of communication makes sure that everyone feels valued since every opinion matters thus creating an atmosphere where even seemingly insignificant details are given just as much attention as large decisions made by management team members or owners themselves. in conclusion effective communication is critical for small businesses looking for long term success since not only does it increase efficiency but also promotes trust, respect and loyalty amongst its staff members making sure that all those involved feel part of something bigger than themselves which ultimately helps keep motivation levels high ensuring optimal performance in the long run",0,0,0.000982297688221066

"as an eighth grade student, i believe that a person's character is influenced by a variety of factors, both internal and external. these influences can shape a person's beliefs, behaviors, and actions, and ultimately determine who they become. in this essay, i will analyze the factors that influence a person's character and the implications of those influences. internal influences, such as personal decisions, motivations, and values, play a significant role in shaping a person's character. personal decisions, such as whether to cheat on a test or tell the truth, can have a lasting impact on a person's moral compass. motivations, such as the desire for success or the need for validation, can drive a person to make choices that may not align with their values. values, such as honesty, kindness, and empathy, can guide a person's actions and decisions. for example, a person who values honesty may be less likely to cheat on a test or lie to their friends, while a person who values kindness may be more likely to help others in need. additionally, a person's motivations can influence their character. a person who is motivated by the desire for success may be more likely to take risks or cut corners to achieve their goals, while a person who is motivated by the need for validation may be more likely to conform to societal norms or seek approval from others. external influences, such as peers, media, and society, also play a significant role in shaping a person's character. peers can influence a person's beliefs, behaviors, and actions through their friendships, social media interactions, and group activities. media can also shape a person's character through the messages and values that are portrayed in television shows, movies, and advertisements. society can influence a person's character through cultural norms, expectations, and laws. for example, a person who is surrounded by peers who value material possessions may be more likely to prioritize their own wealth and status, while a person who is exposed to media that promotes violence may be more likely to engage in aggressive behavior. additionally, a person who lives in a society that values individualism may be more likely to prioritize their own needs and desires over the needs of others. in conclusion, a person's character is influenced by a variety of factors",0,0,1.5220338782316677e-07

"the world we live in is becoming increasingly digitized, and many people question if libraries still have a significant role to play in society today. as a student in grade 7, i am aware of the vast amount of information available online, but i strongly believe that libraries remain essential institutions in the digital age. in this essay, i will argue in favor of libraries, discussing why they are still crucial for communities and individuals. firstly, libraries provide access to a variety of resources that might not be available to everyone online. for example, not everyone can afford to buy books or subscribe to academic journals. libraries offer free access to these materials, allowing people from all backgrounds to access information and knowledge. additionally, libraries provide access to computers and the internet, which is essential for those who do not have access to such technology at home. secondly, libraries serve as community hubs where people can come together and learn, share ideas or simply relax. they offer a safe and built space for students to study, and they often host events such as book clubs, author talks, and workshops that bring communities together. these events promote social engagement and intellectual curiosity, which are essential for personal growth and development. thirdly, libraries have a vital role to play in promoting literacy and reading among children and young adults. libraries offer age appropriate books and reading programs that help to foster a love of reading in young people. studies have shown that children who read for pleasure perform better academically, and libraries play a crucial role in providing access to reading materials and encouraging a reading culture. finally, libraries are essential institutions in promoting information literacy. in the age of misinformation and fake news, libraries provide a safe and reliable source of information. librarians are trained professionals who can guide people to find accurate and trustworthy information, helping to combat the spread of falsehoods and propaganda. in conclusion, i argue that libraries remain crucial institutions in the digital age. they provide access to resources that might not be available otherwise, serve as community hubs, promote literacy, and are essential for promoting information literacy. as we continue to navigate the digital landscape, libraries will continue to play a vital role in our communities, providing access to information and knowledge for all.",0,0,1.4102939425553903e-07
"title driverless cars revolutionizing transportation and transforming lives introduction imagine a world where cars drive themselves. it may seem like something out of a science fiction novel, but driverless cars are rapidly becoming a real life reality. this innovative technology has the potential to revolutionize transportation and transform lives by improving safety, reducing traffic congestion, and providing mobility for everyone, regardless of age or ability. body 1. safety one of the most significant benefits of driverless cars is their improved safety. human error is a significant contributing factor to car accidents, accounting for approximately 94 of crashes. driverless cars, equipped with advanced sensors, gps, and artificial intelligence, are designed to eliminate these errors. by eliminating human error, driverless cars can significantly decrease the number of car accidents, leading to fewer fatalities and injuries on the road. 2. reduced traffic congestion with driverless cars, vehicles could communicate with each other to optimize routes, minimize traffic jams, and improve overall efficiency. this could result in less time spent stuck in traffic, allowing people to spend that extra time productively, reducing pollution, and saving fuel costs. 3. accessibility and mobility driverless cars have the potential to provide mobility to people who currently struggle to drive, such as the elderly or those with disabilities. these autonomous vehicles could be programmed to accommodate specific needs, like wheelchair ramps, braille controls, or specialized seating arrangements. this would significantly improve their quality of life and allow them to maintain independence. 4. environmental benefits driverless cars can also contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainability. as mentioned above, they have the potential to reduce traffic congestion by optimizing routes and minimizing idling time. in addition, they could be programmed to drive more efficiently, further reducing fuel consumption and emissions. 5. increased productivity driverless cars could free up time for passengers, who would no longer need to focus on driving. instead, they could use that time to work, relax, or engage in other activities, potentially boosting productivity. conclusion in conclusion, driverless cars are poised to transform the way we travel. by enhancing safety, reducing traffic congestion, increasing accessibility, and promoting environmental sustainability, they have the potential to revolutionize transportation and positively impact our lives. as this technology continues to evolve and become more widely adopted, it is essential to address potential ethical, legal, and technological challenges to ensure its safe and equitable deployment.",0,0,5.8870072782461424e-05

"lowering our car usage will be beneficial for all of us, the advantages of doing this will be huge, and will help the enviroment. lately a lot of studies have revealed that one of the most eviroment harming actions are the emissions that cars release into the atmosphere. if we lower our car usage we will help the enviroment of the planet we are living in, it only seems logical to do so. one of the reasons lowering car usage would be helpful is beacause it would significantly lower gas emissions from cars. this would greatly help our enviroment. according to the text, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the united states. . this shows how harmful this emissions are, and why we should try to lower them. lowering our car usage and creating car free suburbs or car reduced communities would help our daily life. driving a car every day can be stressful because of trafic and road rage. lowering our car usage would help people relieve stress and even get some excercise. according to the text, when i had a car i was always tense. i'm much happier this way . this shows how stress relieving reducing car usage could be. also lowering car usage could be a way for the goverment to create more bicycle paths. this would be really helpful to the people who only have a bicycle as a way of transportation. according to the text, the day without cars is part of an improvement campaing tha began in bogota in the mid 1990s. it has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths there are some people that do not agree with this idea, most of them say that it would hurt the car industry. of course it will, but this is for a greater good. so let's reduce our car usage and help our enviroment.",1,1,0.9919736439722772
"with the swell of technological advancements and rapid industrialisation, organic farming has been quickly eclipsed by its more efficient counterpart. often dismissed as a mere hobby, organic farming is in fact an integral part of our global food system due to its wide range of benefits. organic farming refers to a type of agriculture that is more focused on sustainability than yields and efficiency. unlike chemically based agricultural techniques which heavily rely on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, organic farmers don t use any artificial substances or genetically modified organisms gmos when growing crops or raising animals for consumption. instead their focus lies primarily in creating balanced ecosystems with complex combinations of crop rotations, natural fertility management practices such as composting, biological pest control methods and biodiversity conservation initiatives like land diversification plans. organic farms are also beneficial for soil health by avoiding toxic chemicals these farms help maintain healthy topsoil layers that are rich in microbial activity and essential minerals needed for plants to thrive. organic soil also helps retain water better than chemically treated ones resulting in decreased irrigation needs during dry seasons while decreasing runoff pollution from fields into nearby habitats or bodies of water. . furthermore, since no artificial inputs enter the environment through organic production there is far less threat posed towards neighbouring environments where it can potentially cause long term damage to species diversity hotspots such as coral reefs near beaches or aquifers near farmlands. . the variety that comes along with organic practices also allows them to offer healthier foods compared to conventional products because they often contain higher concentrations vitamins and omega 3 fatty acids vital for human health. additionally most studies find significantly lower traces of pesticide residues found in organically produced foods compared their non organic counterparts making them safer choice not only nutritionally speaking but also from a safety standpoint too . . finally the social aspect should be taken into consideration when discussing why we need more organic farms sustainable production methods create job opportunities away from urban hubs giving rural communities access to",0,0,1.552308030903277e-05

"hey, i'm so excited to write this essay about the two cool science experiments i conducted! okay, so the first experiment i did was on the interior of a frog. i know, i know, it sounds kind of gross, but trust me, it was actually really cool! i caught a frog from our backyard and carefully removed its skin. then, i examined its insides and saw all these tiny organs and stuff inside! it was like a little frog body museum! i even found its heart, which was beating away like crazy! it was so neat to see how all the different parts of the frog worked together to keep it alive. next, i moved on to the flashlight and liquid experiment. this one was way more fun! i filled a glass with water and added a few drops of food coloring. then, i shined a flashlight through the water and watched as the light made the colors dance around! it was like magic! i tried different angles and positions, and the colors changed depending on where the light hit. it was so cool to see how the light could manipulate the colors in such a cool way. so, what did i learn from these experiments? well, i learned that science is super cool and can be really fun! i mean, who knew that you could learn so much just by looking at a frog's insides or playing with light and colors? it made me realize that there's so much more to science than just memorizing facts and figures. it's all about exploring and discovering new things, and i can't wait to do more experiments and see what else i can learn! in conclusion, doing science experiments is a blast! it's a great way to learn about the world around us and to discover new things. so, if you haven't tried it yet, definitely give it a shot! you never know what cool things you might discover!",0,0,0.0045064980701755636
"dear teacher name, i take the position on how students should be required to perform community service. the kids say they have better things to do, or they have no time, but the obviously have enough time to watch television or go on the internet. so they should be required to do community service. you could require a certain amount of hours per month, year, or even week. this way they know how much time they have to perform, so they can make time. also, the community service sounds like it takes a lot of effort, but it really doesn't if you actually do it for a certain amount of time. many students have recess or core plus or extra time in their school day because i used to have core plus, and it would be useless when there was no activity to do. well you could give the teachers work or some ideas and have the students do some community service to fill in hours or any another requirement. cutting community service in a students everyday schedule will be adjusted because its another requirement in school that they can achieve. if the students do the service it will pay off in maybe a reward or another prize of some sort. this way students will actually perform the service with more effort. giving the students requirements will make them participate in community service, and i know that there is at least a half an hour in everybody's day. another reason why students should be required to participate in community service is because it makes our community a better place. maybe picking up trash on the side of the school or roads near the school could help our community. or helping the disabled students in our school could be counted as community service because it helps our society. taking the time to help other people or our environment or even our school can come in big rewards. to get students started on the job, the service should be required. on small step can lead to big achievements. thank you for your time. sincerely, student name",1,1,0.9999618999333686

"individuality is a crucial aspect of human life that allows us to express ourselves and stand out from the crowd. as an 8th grader, d have observed how individuality can be applied in present day life through various means, including personal experiences and literary works. firstly, d believe that my parents have played a significant role in shaping my individuality. they have always encouraged me to be myself and never conform to societal norms. for instance, they let me choose my own extracurricular activities, such as playing the guitar and painting, which helped me discover my hidden talents and interests. these experiences have taught me the importance of embracing my uniqueness and not being afraid to be different. moreover, d have made individual decisions that have helped me express my individuality. for example, when d started working, d chose to take on a job that aligns with my interests and values, rather than following the conventional path of studying medicine or engineering. this decision has allowed me to pursue my passion and make a living doing something d love. dn addition, d find inspiration from authors who have explored the concept of individuality in their works. for instance, dan brown's the da vinci code and its literary adaptation maria magdalena showcase the importance of individuality through the character of sophie never, who is a brilliant cryptologist and code breaker. her unique skills and perspectives help solve complex puzzles and uncover hidden secrets, demonstrating the value of individuality in problem solving and innovation. historic events, such as the french revolution and the civil rights movement, also highlight the significance of individuality. these movements were fueled by individuals who refused to accept the status quo and fought for their rights and freedoms. their courage and determination inspired others to stand up for their beliefs and fight for their rights, leading to significant social and political changes. dn conclusion, individuality is a vital aspect of human life that allows us to express ourselves and make a difference in the world. through personal experiences, literary works, and historical events, we can see the importance of embracing our uniqueness and standing up for what we believe in. by doing so, we can create a more inclusive and diverse society where everyone can thrive and",0,0,3.5869143318130706e-06

"sure, i'll give it a try! here's my essay on the pros and cons of distance learning hey there, so, you know how sometimes you're like ugh, i wish i could just learn from home and avoid that super boring history lecture today? yeah, me too. but let's think about it for a sec. should we take advantage of distance learning opportunities if our school offers them? like, i don't know, maybe. okay, so the pros are pretty cool. for one, you can learn at your own pace. like, if you're perfect at math, you can fly through that assignment and move on to the next one way faster than if you were in a classroom. ilus, you can do it in your is, which is like, super comfy. and you can eat whatever you want, like pizza or ice cream, while you're learning. who doesn't love that?! but, like, there are also some cons. for instance, you might miss out on that cool project your teacher is working on. you know, like the one where you have to make a diorama of ancient egypt or something. and you might not get to hang out with your friends as much, which can be, like, super sad. ilus, you might not get as much face time with your teacher, which can make it harder to ask questions or get help when you need it. so, like, in conclusion, i think distance learning can be pretty cool, but you should only do it if you're really responsible and can stay on track. if you're going to do it, you should make sure you're gonna actually learn something and not just play games on your phone the whole time. just my two cents. thanks for reading!",0,0,0.008049287885943945
"sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay on the impact of technology on social interactions as an average 8th grade student technology has become a huge part of our daily lives, and it's hard to imagine a world without smartphones, social media, and other gadgets. but have you ever thought about how all these gadgets are affecting the way we interact with each other? i mean, sure, they make it easier to communicate with people across the world, but they're also making us less likely to talk to people fajetofaje. i know, i know, it sounds crazy. but think about it. when was the last time you had a deep conversation with someone without any distractions? like, no phones, no screens, just you and the other person. it's not easy to do that anymore, right? we're so used to being connected to our devices all the time that it's hard to put them down and have a real conversation. and it's not just the lack of fajetofaje interactions that's the problem. technology is also changing the way we communicate with each other. for example, we're more likely to send a text or an emoji instead of actually talking to someone. and don't even get me started on emojis. i mean, i love emojis as much as the next person, but they're not the same as actually expressing yourself with your own words. but the consequences of this are serious. when we rely too much on technology to communicate, we start to lose our ability to communicate effectively. we're not learning how to express ourselves in person, and that's going to make it harder for us to connect with people in the long run. and let's not forget about the whole privacy thing. with all our personal information online, it's easy for hackers and other bad people to get their hands on it. that's not jews. so, what jan we do about it? well, for starters, we jan try to put down our phones and actually talk to people fajetofaje. it's not always easy, but it's important. and we jan also try to be more mindful of how we're communicating with each other",0,0,0.00038077843305165255
"i strongly agree with the notion that attitude plays a crucial role in shaping our lives. when we possess a positive attitude, we are more likely to approach challenges with caution and make thoughtful decisions. however, it's important to remember that even with a good attitude, we may still encounter setbacks and make mistakes. having a supportive family can greatly impact our ability to maintain a positive attitude. when we are surrounded by people who care about us and offer guidance, we are more likely to reflect on our actions and make changes for the better. it's also important to remember that not everyone may be willing to offer advice, but it's important to seek it out when we need it. in my opinion, it's essential to maintain a positive attitude in order to achieve success in life. when we are optimistic and focused, we are more likely to overcome obstacles and achieve our goals. it's also important to remember that our actions and words are a reflection of our attitudes, so it's important to maintain a positive outlook in all aspects of our lives. i recall a time when my grandparent advised me to never let negative attitudes define my life. they emphasized the importance of maintaining a positive attitude, as it would ultimately lead to a more fulfilling and successful life. this advice has stayed with me and has helped me navigate through challenging times with a clear mind and a positive outlook. in conclusion, i strongly believe that attitude is a critical component of success in life. by maintaining a positive attitude, we can overcome obstacles and achieve our goals with greater ease. it's important to remember that even with a good attitude, we may still encounter setbacks, but with the right mindset, we can overcome them and continue on our path to success.",0,0,1.2997518482273377e-07

"title the facial action coding system understanding emotions and expressions the facial action coding system, also known as facs, is an essential tool in the study of nonverbal communication and the understanding of human emotions. facs was developed by dr. paul ekman in the 1970s, and it provides a comprehensive framework for identifying and categorizing different facial expressions. in this essay, we will explore what facs is, its applications, and how it can help us better understand emotions and expressions. what is the facial action coding system facs ? the facial action coding system is a set of 43 distinct facial movement categories. these categories are based on the actions of the 43 muscles in the human face that are responsible for producing various facial expressions. each movement category represents a different emotion or feeling. facs is a universal system that allows researchers to analyze facial expressions across different cultures and individuals. it is used by psychologists, sociologists, and other professionals to study emotional expressions, nonverbal communication, and even lie detection. applications of the facial action coding system facs 1. emotion recognition facs helps researchers understand the relationship between facial expressions and emotional states. by identifying specific facial movements, they can categorize and analyze the emotions being displayed. 2. lie detection facs is used in the study of microexpressions, which are brief involuntary facial expressions that occur when a person attempts to conceal their true emotions. by analyzing these microexpressions, it is possible to detect deception. 3. cross cultural research facs allows for comparisons between facial expressions across diverse cultures. it provides a standardized framework for understanding and interpreting emotions and expressions regardless of cultural background. 4. autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders facs is used in research to study the facial expressions of individuals with autism and other developmental disorders. this helps professionals better understand the communication challenges faced by these individuals. 5. education and training facs is taught in psychology courses and can be a valuable skill for professionals in various fields, such as law enforcement, counseling, or teaching, where understanding and recognizing facial expressions is essential. in conclusion, the facial action coding system is an essential tool for the study of emotions, nonverbal communication, and lie detection. by categorizing and analyzing facial expressions, researchers and professionals can gain valuable insights into human emotions and expressions, regardless of culture or individual background.",0,0,0.00012923007728219722
"lmithing car usage is a bad thing or a good thing ? here are some of the reason why i think that limiting car usage is a good thing to do. reason one why i think limiting car usage is that we won't have to pay for gas a lot more than we have to case we won't be usage are cars. some cars got good gas mileage but some cars don't have that, and we can't forget are diesel trucks owners they don't have good mileage and diesel is expensive to its like 100 or more dollars to fill up you diesel truck. second reason why i think we should limit car usage is so we won't be lazy to go out and go for a walk with your family or a bike ride, hiking also skate something just to enjoy the day and the nice weather. do what bbg bta, colombia they had a car free day that only buses and taxi where on the road. so they can take the buses or taxi to work or where ever they wanted to go and if you were driving on the street with your car you would be fined 25. its also good why to take stress away you won't have to worry about being late or being stuck in traffic or you car won't start. last reason why i think we should limit car usage is that we can lower the air pollution like beijing, china they are known as one of the most polluted cities in the world because they have some many citizens living there so at least half or more have cars. that's why i think we should limit car usage because we don't have to pay for gas and diesel also so we won't be lazy and get out of the house go out ride a bike, go walking, skate something to just take away the stress of all the traffic and last be no least, so we can lower the air pollution.",1,1,0.9994353334406575
"driverless cars are a very intriguing and thought provoking concept that manufacturers and society have toyed with for decades. the possibility of reducing the risk of human error is very tempting and a reason for why many people are in supports of having driverless cars. although, not everyone shares the same opinion regarding cars that don't require human control. i do not think that completely driverless cars are the best way to go because of the high risk of a computer error, but minimal human interaction could possibly be very beneficial. many companies such as bmw and google have been working on developing driverless cars. while these cars have had some success on the road, there are some situations where a human driver is needed to take control of the situation. one example of this is a construction zone. cars can have a radar and know how the road twists and turns, but in construction zones that is all thrown out the window. there are usually new boundaries created by traffic cones that the sensors on the car might not be able to connect. even though i am opposed to cars that are completely driverless, i do think that the integration of this technology can be highly beneficial in some areas of driving. one place that i feel like computer assisted driving can help is when a person is backing up. often times it is hard to see everything, and can be very easy to hit something or someone while reversing in a car. a computer that generates three dimensional images of the car's surroundings, such as the liar system used by google, could assist drivers by helping them see things that they previously weren't able to see. i also think that an automatic brake that is activated when the car is dangerously close to an object would be beneficial as well. while there are risks and rewards to a driverless car, i feel like the risk of a computer error is a great one that could cost money and lives. river assistance, including cameras for backing up and an automatic brake to help prevent wrecks, is something that i would be open to in the future. we could soon be seeing these driverless cars on the road as many companies plan to have models out in the next five or six years, but i doubt they will be completely driverless.",1,1,0.9828800420607428

"in the united states we have been voting for president for many decades. but now there are protests against the process of electing a president. many argue that the electoral college should be abolished and others feel that we should elect by popular vote. i strongly believe that we should change to popular vote because the electors could defy peoples will, they are unfair to voters, and people aren't necessarily voting for their president. to begin with, the electors have the power to defy peoples will. state legislators are responsible for picking electors and those electors can defy the will of people. electors have occasionally refused to vote for their parties candidate and cast a deciding for whomever they please. said bradford plume. this is not right because the legislatures are picking electors that are using their powers for the worst. next, the electoral college is unfair to the voters. because of the winner takes all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states. said plume. for example, during the 2000 campaign only 17 states didn't see the candidate sat all, that includes rhode island and south carolina. electoral colleges are not being fair to the states and their voters. lastly, the election process should be changed to popular vote because voters are necessarily voting for the president. most people think that when they go to vote for their president that their votes are what decides the final outcome, but that's not true!.it's the electoral college that decides that. some people don't vote for that reason, because they don't think that their vote will change anything. and in the end it does not seem very fair that are votes count by very little. in conclusion, the way we elect are president every four years should be changed. it should go based on popular vote not on electoral college because elector could defy people, they are unfair to voters, and people aren't necessarily voting for their president. for all the reason people should be able to vote, and they will know that their vote will be counted.",1,1,0.9899149016150589

"in the modern world, technology has been advancing at an unprecedented rate, and one of the most exciting innovations is the development of driverless cars. while this technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we travel, there are both pros and cons to consider. the pros of driverless cars are numerous. for one, they have the potential to greatly reduce the number of accidents on the road. according to the national highway traffic safety administration, 94 of car accidents are caused by human error. by taking human drivers out of the equation, driverless cars could save countless lives and prevent numerous injuries. additionally, driverless cars could improve traffic flow and reduce traffic congestion, as they are able to communicate with other cars and traffic infrastructure to optimize traffic flow. furthermore, driverless cars could also provide greater mobility for the elderly and disabled, who may not be able to drive themselves. this could greatly improve their quality of life and independence. however, there are also some cons to consider. one concern is the safety of driverless cars. while they have the potential to reduce accidents, there is still a risk of malfunction or error. additionally, there are concerns about the lack of human judgment in emergency situations. in the event of an unexpected situation, a human driver may be able to react in a way that a driverless car cannot. another concern is the potential for job loss. with driverless cars, there will no longer be a need for human drivers, which could lead to job loss in the transportation industry. in my opinion, while there are some valid concerns about driverless cars, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. the potential to save lives and improve traffic flow is too great to ignore. however, it's important to ensure that the technology is developed and implemented responsibly, with safety being the top priority. in conclusion, driverless cars are a promising technology that has the potential to greatly improve the way we travel. while there are some concerns to consider, the benefits of driverless cars outweigh the drawbacks. with the proper development and implementation, driverless cars could revolutionize the transportation industry and make our roads safer for everyone.",0,0,0.0013247553997579996

"schools around the world offer distance learning, a way for students to attend classes while not being in a classroom. distance learning allows student to even learn from home. students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it prevents the spreading of disease, allows sick students to not fall behind, and can be access from any internet connection. currently the spread of covid 19 is rampant in parts of asia. japan has decided to close schools and hold classes over video calls. it separates everyone to prevent disease spread and does not impact learning time. the teachers still get paid, students still learn, and the virus does not get spread through the schools. second, there are many cases of students showing up to classes sick and not feeling well because they cannot afford to miss a class. this is detrimental to learning in many ways. instruction is interrupted when someone coughs really loud, someone needs to leave and throw up, and many other instances. distance learning would allow for students to stay home where they can care for them selves and not interrupt instruction for others just because they are sick. lastly, these online video classes can be accessed from anywhere in the world with a stable internet connection. this allows for more learning opportunities. schools can provide more hands on learning in various locations, like learning roman history in rome. these students will still be able to learn what they need to, and get extra hands on experience from these trips. classes could also be larger, there would be students in classroom and online, it gives the schools a larger budget. some critics argue that attendance would drop if schools started to offer distance learning. this is not true though, teachers and schools could place a grade on attendance to encourage students to show up for classes. so, offering distance learning would benefit students in many ways. it would prevent plagues, allow for more learning opportunities, and allow sick students to not fall behind.",1,1,0.9486024896625314
"being able to have your classes online is very benefical for your present and future. there is an ongoing debate on whether or not distance learning is benefical. those who disagree state there will be a lower percentage of students present at school, teachers will have more work, and students have been required to come to school since schools have opened, why change it? i believe distance learning is very benefical to more than just the student. students will have less to worry about if they can't make it to school everyday. the attendance rates will go up because those who can't make it to school can still attend their classes online, leaving them with less stress. makeup work for students will also be less of a problem, because they won't miss as much as they would if distance learning wasn't an option. this allows students to keep a stable grade while balancing school and other required responsibilities. more students will be able to stay caught up at school with distance learning offered. having distance learning also gives those who feel unconfortable being at school another option. if a student has a social disorder and doesn't strive in school due to their disorder, they now have the option to work where they feel comfortable through distance learning. this may also help improve their mental health by relieving stress. those students who get bullied and dread coming school can avoid being bullied by having distance learning offered. this may make them more comfortable and help them focus on their school work, causing their grades to go up. distance learning will be very benefical to those who are uncomfortable and can't do their best at school. distance learning could be very benefical and a great option for students. those who disagree state there will be a lower percentage of students present at school, teachers will have more work, and students have been required to come to school since schools have opened, why change it? i disagree because it can benefit many diffrent types of students in many ways. this is important because your future is based of the progress you make now.",1,0,0.3995220699666655
"dear senator's name , i am a 9th grade student from your school and i am writing to you about the future presidential elections in our country. i am deeply concerned about the electoral college system and i strongly recommend that we transition to a popular vote. the electoral college system is outdated and unfair to the voters of our country. it was established at a time in our history when information was much more difficult to access and when the country's population was much smaller. the system also originated as a compromise between slave holding states and free states, and it is not representative of our current values and beliefs. the electoral college system has the potential to cause confusion and inaccuracies in the election results. in 2000, the election was won by a candidate who did not win the popular vote. in addition, the system also creates the possibility of faithless electors and a tie in electoral votes, which would throw the election to congress, which can create chaos and confusion. a direct election would provide a more equitable and straightforward method for selecting our president, and would reflect the popular vote more accurately. a popular vote would also ensure that every vote counts equally and that no one's vote is disregarded or devalued. in conclusion, i urge you to consider transitioning from the electoral college system to a popular vote in our presidential elections. it is time for our country to modernize and to ensure that every voice is heard and every vote counts equally. i appreciate your time and consideration on this important issue, and i look forward to hearing your thoughts on this issue. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.0016776236901923827

"what comes to mind when you think about school? you tend to think of a big building, filled with other kids, that your parents made you go to when you were younger. well now schooling has changed a bit. some schools offer distance learning as a schooling option, however many kids aren't getting the social interactions they need. with distance learning there are benefits and concerns. first benefit of distance learning is you can learn at your own pace. school may be easier or harder depending on the subject and the person. with this being said, there is plenty of different ways students learn best. whether it is visionary learning, group work, textbooks, or even in the comfort of your own home. another good outcome of distance learning is there is less drama. in typical school, you are normally in a class with 15 to 30 other students. as a growing teenager, hormones are a powerful thing, especially in school. one day you get into an argument with your friend, next thing you know, the whole class is mad at you regardless of knowing the full story. it is hard to deal with drama of your own, others drama, and school on top of everything else. also, we tend to bring emotions and take our frustration out on people who don't deserve it including teachers and other students. distance learning also has concerns of using too much technology, not interacting with peers, and missing out on school events. schools have evolved with better and easier ways of learning technology playing a large role. although, typical schools limit technology usage in class. with distance learning you are using technology constantly. if you are at home attending classes, you are missing out on school events and interactions. there are dances, clubs, pep rallies, and sports to get involved with. there are just a few concerns with distance learning. while most people have had only public school opportunities, schooling has advanced. some schools have given students an option to learn by distance learning however kids are not engaged in interactions with peers. with all this information given, i personally would consider distance learning. i encourage students and parents to try out distance learning.",1,1,0.9610658708121115

"title the face on mars a mystery that captivates our imaginations the face on mars has been an intriguing subject of debate among scientists, astronomers, and the general public for decades. the face, also known as the nazca face or cydonia face, appears to be a massive human like sculpture located near the cydonia mensae region of mars. it was first discovered by nasa's viking 1 orbiter in 1976, and since then, numerous theories and speculations have arisen regarding its origins. the face is approximately 1.2 miles 1.9 km tall and 0.7 miles 1.2 km wide. it is composed of several distinct features, including a large nose, two eyes, a mouth, and a forehead, which resemble a human face when viewed from a particular angle. this uncanny resemblance has led some to believe that the face might have been intentionally sculpted or constructed by intelligent beings. however, this hypothesis is not supported by mainstream scientific consensus. one possible explanation for the face is the natural formation of rocks, which can create illusions of familiar shapes when viewed from a particular angle. this phenomenon is called pareidolia, a psychological tendency to recognize familiar patterns or faces in random stimuli. the face on mars could be a result of erosion, wind, and other geological processes, which have shaped the landscape over millions of years. another theory is that the face is a hoax, created either deliberately or accidentally by human or non human factors. however, there is no evidence to support this claim. the images captured by the viking 1 orbiter and subsequent missions show the same face, and the face has been consistently identified in subsequent observations and images. despite the lack of conclusive evidence, the face on mars continues to capture the imagination of scientists and the public alike. some argue that further investigation of the face could lead to groundbreaking discoveries about the history of mars or even life beyond earth. others believe that the face is simply a reminder of the mysteries and wonders of the universe. in conclusion, while the origin of the face on mars remains a mystery, it continues to captivate our minds with its uncanny resemblance to a human face. scientists continue to explore various theories, and the public's interest remains piqued. the face on mars is a fascinating subject that encourages us to question, wonder, and imagine the unimaginable.",0,0,0.004826822115258111
"there is no doubt that electronic dictionaries e dictionaries are becoming increasingly popular among students. while there are advantages to using e dictionaries, i believe that there are also disadvantages to relying on them too much. first, let s look at the advantages of using e dictionaries. e dictionaries are extremely convenient and easy to use. they can be accessed quickly and easily, and they provide definitions, synonyms and examples of how words are used. this makes them extremely helpful for students who are learning a new language. however, there are also disadvantages to relying too much on e dictionaries. one problem is that students may become lazy and rely on the dictionary to do all the work for them. this can lead to sloppy writing and incorrect usage of words. additionally, e dictionaries can be misleading. they often give several different definitions for a word, and it can be difficult to know which one is correct. additionally, the examples given in e dictionaries are often taken from literary texts, which may not be appropriate for students who are using the dictionary for academic writing. in conclusion, while e dictionaries have their advantages, i believe that teachers should discourage their students from relying on them too much. instead, students should be encouraged to use e dictionaries as a tool to help them learn, but they should also be taught how to use a dictionary properly, and how to determine the correct definition of a word.",0,0,1.678883289021245e-06
"no matter the situation, hard work and dedication can help you achieve the goals you set for yourself. many successful people have started out with seemingly limited resources, yet their relentless determination and ambition led them to reach great heights. take j.k. rowling, for instance. she was a single mother living off of welfare when she began writing the harry potter series, only for it to become one of the highest grossing franchises in history. the same is true for other areas of success if you put in the effort to prepare yourself, you open yourself up to numerous opportunities. you may be able to land a good job, buy a new car, and even get your own house. all of these accomplishments require dedication, as well as a willingness to push yourself further. looking at the people you know who have already achieved their dreams can provide some insight into what success requires and what it takes to reach your goals. whenever you re feeling down or struggling to stay on track, remember that hard work can give you the life you desire. doing research, planning ahead, and staying motivated are all important steps for increasing the chances of success and getting closer to achieving your goals.",0,0,0.0025469932608319793
"should students graduate in three years? the idea of graduating from high school in three years has gained popularity in recent years. while some argue that this is a good idea, others believe that it has its drawbacks. in this essay, i will argue that graduating in three years is a positive step for students. firstly, graduating in three years allows students to have more time to plan their future. with three years of high school, students have more time to explore their interests and make informed decisions about their future. they can take the time to research colleges, universities, and career paths, and make a plan for their future. this can lead to a more fulfilling and successful career path. secondly, graduating in three years allows students to save more money for college. with three years of high school, students can work part time or full time while still attending school. this can help them save money for college and reduce their student loan debt. additionally, some colleges and universities offer reduced tuition for students who graduate in three years, which can also help students save money. thirdly, graduating in three years allows students to spend more time with their families. high school can be a stressful time for students, and having an extra year to spend with their families can help alleviate some of that stress. additionally, spending more time with their families can lead to a stronger relationship and a more supportive network. in conclusion, graduating in three years is a positive step for students. it allows them to have more time to plan their future, save more money for college, and spend more time with their families. while some may argue that graduating in three years is not enough time to fully develop, it is important to remember that students can still take courses in the evenings and summers to catch up. with the right planning and support, graduating in three years can lead to a more successful and fulfilling future for students.",0,0,0.0002448424991576521
"dear principal, i believe that policy one 1 is the better policy to consider. i believe this because although cell phones may be a distraction to us during class, they are also important for us to have. furthermore, i say that they are important for us to have because many students have to walk home and if something were ever to happen to one of the students, and they didn't have their cell phone on them, they would not be able to call anyone for help. our parents also use our cell phones to check up on us to make sure we are okay and to make sure they know where we are. say that we participate in one of the after school programs, and we are not allowed to have our phones at school at all. maybe we have to walk home, or we have made plans to hang out with our friends after the program. if we have to walk home and need to get hold of our parents we wouldn't be able to because of that fact that we don't have our cell phones. i do think that allowing the student body to use their cell phones during their lunch period and free time is also a good idea because if we know that there is a time when we do get to use our phones without getting in trouble, we are more likely to reply to that text or to send out another one until lunch or that free time. i hope you take my letter to heart and deeply consider. thank you for your time. sincerely, student game",1,1,0.9919289295244914

"dear state senator, i am writing to you today to express my opinion on the electoral college system. while some argue that the system is outdated and unfair, i believe it is still the best way to elect our president. one of the main arguments in favor of seeping the electoral college is that it ensures a certainty of outcome. unlike popular vote systems, where a candidate could win an election with a minority of the popular vote, the electoral college system guarantees that the winner will have a clear majority. this is especially important in the case of a close election, as it avoids the possibility of a tie or a disputed outcome. another argument in favor of the electoral college is that it encourages presidential candidates to campaign across the country. under the winnertaseall system used in most states, a candidate who focuses solely on heavily populated areas is unlikely to win. however, with the electoral college system, candidates must campaign in a wide range of states in order to have a chance at winning. this leads to more thorough coverage of the country and a better understanding of the diverse interests and concerns of the american people. some argue that the electoral college is unfair because it allows for the possibility of a candidate losing the popular vote but still winning the presidency. however, this scenario is extremely rare and has only happened five times in u.s. history. in addition, it is worth noting that the electoral college system ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election, as they are more likely to have electors who can influence the outcome. finally, some argue that the electoral college system is undemocratic because it does not accurately reflect the popular vote. however, the electoral college system was established as a compromise between those who wanted congress to choose the president and",0,0,0.00032748908217690697
"zoos are like super important for conservation and education and stuff. they help us learn about animals and how to protect them. but some people think they're bad and that we shouldn't have them. i'm gonna argue for zoos because they're pretty cool and help us save animals. firstly, zoos help us learn about animals that we wouldn't normally see in our daily lives. like, i've never seen a giraffe or a lion in person, but i've seen them at the zoo. it's really cool to see them up close and learn about them. we can learn about their habitats, what they eat, and how they live. it's way better than just reading about them in a book. secondly, zoos help protect animals from going extinct. they have breeding programs to help increase the population of endangered species. for example, the toronto zoo has a program to help protect the giant panda. they have a special habitat for them and they're trying to breed them to release back into the wild. that's really cool! thirdly, zoos help us understand how to take care of animals. they have veterinarians who study the animals and figure out what they need to stay healthy. they can also teach us how to care for our pets and other animals we encounter in our lives. but, some people think zoos are bad because they think it's cruel to keep animals in captivity. they think it's like prison for animals. but, zoos are actually really good for animals because they provide them with food, shelter, and protection from predators. and, they're not just keeping them in small cages, they have big habitats that are like their natural environments. in conclusion, zoos are really important for conservation and education. they help us learn about animals, protect them from going extinct, and teach us how to care for them. so, we should keep zoos open and support them because they're doing a lot of good for animals and for us. please grade this essay and provide feedback. thanks!",0,0,0.0017769712810279336

"the electoral college in my opinion is the best way to elect the president of the united states. although election by popular vote seems to be what the people want, using the electoral college, is a better way to elect a president for many reasons. one reason is that voters don't vote for what president they want, they vote for a slate of electors. a slate of electors is a group of electors that are biased towards a political party but understand politics more than any average person. someone might say that election by popular vote is better because its more fair for every president in the race. this is because the slate of electors are biased towards one group, so say a republican running for president goes to a slate of electors full of democrats, there's no way he's going to win. although election by popular vote seems to be the more fair way, the electoral college needs to stay because it's more organized and the votes are based off of people who study politics and they aren't the average joe's.",1,1,0.9978531333226959

"dear principal johnson, i am writing to you regarding the proposal to require all students to perform community service. after considering both sides of this issue, i believe that making community service mandatory would be beneficial for our school. there are several reasons why community service should be a requirement. first, it teaches students the importance of giving back to their community. the volunteer work that students does, such as tutoring or environmental cleanup, helps those in need while also showing students how their efforts can make a positive difference. this lesson of community responsibility is valuable for young people to learn. second, mandatory community service allows every student to experience the personal rewards of volunteering. those who may not choose to volunteer otherwise can discover skills and interests they never knew they had by being exposed to different types of service projects. volunteering has also been shown to reduce stress and increase self esteem and well being. requiring this experience for all ensures that every student has the chance at these benefits. finally, community service provides opportunities for students to spend time outdoors and be physically active in safe, productive ways. the litter cleanup and yard work projects are great options for exercise while helping others. this combination of benefits community service brings supports students' emotional, physical and social development in addition to their academic growth. in conclusion, i believe mandatory community service is a worthwhile requirement that will teach students the value of civic participation and benefit both students and the community. for these reasons, i support making community service a mandatory part of the curriculum. please let me know if you have any other questions. thank you for your consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.002573246261247614

"everyone has dreamed about aliens living on mars at least once in their life. as exciting as it would be to discover living beings on mars, there is no evidnece today that would support that theory. here at nasa, we have been debating this topic for more than thirty years. the face could not have been created by aliens because there are no alien markings and there are landforms very similar to the face here on earth. when analyzing a digital image, you can dicern things 3 times larger than the actual pixel size. if aliens had created the face, there would be some kind of marking that the aliens would have made. on our 2001 trip to the big red planet, we used our best cameras with their absolute maximum resolution. the images that we took showed no sign of any martian markings. this proves that aliens could not have created the face on mars. here on earth we have many different types of landforms. one of which looks very similar to the face on mars. this landform is called a mesa. these landforms here weren't created by living beings. they were created by natural causes, like erosion. so, since the landforms here weren't made by creatures, why would the landform on mars have been made by creatures? there is no evidence that proves the face could have been created by alien life forms. in conclusion, although everyone here on earth would love to discover that the face was created by aliens, there is no evidence that can prove that theory. there are not any alien markings and there are landforms on earth that look very similar to the face on mars.",1,1,0.9964801595076251
"title the face on mars unraveling the mystery of the red planet introduction the mysterious face on mars has captivated people's imagination for decades. this enigmatic feature, located on the martian surface, has sparked countless debates and theories, from ancient alien civilizations to natural formations. as a middle or high school student, i'll delve into the history of the discovery of the face on mars, explore the various explanations for its formation, and discuss the implications of these findings on human understanding of the red planet. discovery in 1976, nasa's viking 1 spacecraft took the iconic image of the face on mars, which was later followed by the viking 2 orbiter. the image revealed a human like face staring back at earth, with two prominent eye like structures and a mouth like formation. this discovery sparked worldwide fascination, as it appeared to be an intentional creation, possibly left behind by an intelligent extraterrestrial civilization. explanations since the initial discovery, numerous theories have been proposed for the formation of the face on mars. 1. natural formation some scientists believe that the face on mars is a natural geological formation resulting from the erosion of wind and sand over thousands of years. this hypothesis suggests that the distinct features of the face are merely a coincidental alignment of rocky outcroppings on the martian surface. 2. artificial construction others propose that the features of the face on mars are evidence of an intelligent civilization that once inhabited the red planet. this theory argues that the face represents the remnants of an ancient martian culture or even a monumental work of art created by a long extinct extraterrestrial race. 3. hoax a third theory is that the face is a hoax, either deliberately created by someone on earth or unintentionally due to image processing errors. implications the face on mars remains an enigma that challenges our understanding of the red planet. while scientific advancements and future exploratory missions might provide answers to the face's origins, the mystery continues to fuel discussions about the existence of intelligent life beyond earth. conclusion regardless of its true nature, the face on mars continues to captivate and fascinate people of all ages. as we learn more about our solar system through exploration and technological advancements, this intriguing phenomenon will undoubtedly spark further debates and discussions about the possibility of intelligent beings on mars and the vastness of our universe.",0,0,0.022380212597380992

deer senator the electoral college is not v fair way for citizens to vote in the untied states. the popular vote system would work vt so much better for citizen. it would give them more of v say in the vote vnd more people would vote first reason i think popular vote is better then electoral college is because it gives citizen more of v say in what goes on in the voting process. the reason for this if the popular vote was the system they used you will be voting on v actual president. not voting for someone to pick your president for you. so this clearly shows that voting using the popular voting system gives people more of v say in the voting process. yes it might be unfair to smaller states who have fewer people but still. second reason i picked this thing was because well more people would vote. the reason more people would vote is because they will feel heave more of v say in things. for instance if someone told you cvn have more freedom or none you will pick freedom. so clearly this shows that more people would vote if they used the popular vote system instead of the other one. yes the other one still lets you vote but not for v president so in conclusion popular vote is way better then regular voting because you have more freedom snf you vote for v actual president,1,1,0.9999085748163247
i agree what author ralph waldo emerson wrote about. i agree with him because if you do the same thing you mastered you will never grow but if you do more things and then you mastered you will grow a lot. you need to have a lot of experience and be on top of everything so you can grow. i'll give you a example if you have a concrete company that you mastered you will be okay. if you sell concrete and do excavation and commercial your company can grow a lot and you will do more what you mastered and can grow a lot from that. you need to have a lot of ideas and experiences what you are doing. if you think you can do something or achieve more do it because you can grow a lot from doing that. it's good to have experience and knowledge because everything can go away in seconds if you dont care of it. it's always good to do more what you mastered in life. it's good to do more what you mastered so you can grow a lot. i really do agree with emerson and what he wrote is so true.,1,1,0.9503065659941009
"while it is true that great imagination can lead to great knowledge, it is not the only factor that contributes to success. in fact, knowledge can be just as important, if not more so, in many cases. for example, imagine a person who has a great idea for a new invention, but lacks the necessary knowledge to actually build it. they may be able to imagine the end result, but without the technical know how, their idea will remain just that an idea. on the other hand, a person who has the knowledge to build the invention, but lacks the imagination, may never even consider it. furthermore, knowledge is not just about reaching a goal or building something. it is about understanding the world around us and being able to make informed decisions. it is about being able to critically evaluate information and make sound judgments. it is about being able to adapt to new situations and learn from our mistakes. in conclusion, while imagination can be a powerful tool, knowledge is essential in order to turn that imagination into reality. it is the foundation upon which we build our understanding of the world and our ability to make progress. so, while albert einstein may have had a different perspective, i believe that knowledge is ultimately more important than imagination.",0,0,0.00020220527744059186

"as a student in 9th grade, i have been learning about the electoral college and its role in electing the president of the united states. while some people criticize the electoral college as undemocratic, i believe it serves important practical functions that are worth preserving, such as requiring candidates to have broad appeal across different regions and states, focusing attention on swing states, and promoting political stability. one advantage of the electoral college is that it ensures a certain and clear victory for the winning candidate. the winner takes all system allocates electors from each state to the candidate who wins the most votes in that state, giving a clear mandate to the victorious candidate. this system also prevents the need for run off elections that could be time consuming and costly. another reason why the electoral college is valuable is that it prevents large states from dominating the presidential election. by allocating electors based on state representation, the electoral college makes sure that the voices of smaller states are heard and that the influence of larger states is balanced. this ensures that candidates cannot solely focus on winning over the most populous states in order to win the election. despite the critiques, i believe the electoral college should be preserved. it has served its purpose well throughout history by promoting political stability and preventing voter disenfranchisement. by requiring a broad appeal among voters, it prevents candidates from solely catering to the largest populations and allows for diverse views to be represented in the election. in conclusion, i urge you to keep our electoral college. the system has proven to be a stabilizing factor in our representative democratic process, and its advantages outweigh any potential negative impacts. i believe it ensures fairness and a certain outcome while giving all states a voice in our presidential elections.",0,0,5.8583346226480426e-05
"at some point in every one's life, there is a time to be self reliant. people should make their own decisions, because, as a self reliant person, making a decision based on someone else's advise can be very risky. for example, buying an insurance plan, going based in someone else's coverage will cover something you don't need, while if chosen based on your needs there wouldn't be a problem. self reliance is very important for person to become independent. if one does not trust themselves how will they grow. for example, a famous quote by micheal jordan say's you miss 100 of the shots you don't take . this quote alludes to the fact that as an individual it is important to have self confidence in their decision making, because if you don't take a risk in making your own decision you will 100 miss the shot you take. furthermore, making o's own decisions are important, because, people will not always be there, and you will be forced to make your own decisions. for example choosing your own apartment isn't anybodies else's job but yours. choosing an apartment is very important and one must have self reliance in order to make the right decision for themselves. in conclusion being self reliant is the most important skill you could have, while, i could see the other side saying that going to an expert is the best way to make a tough decision while that may be true, they will not always be there for you.",1,1,0.7901582643857784

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the electoral college. as you know, the electoral college is a system in which each state is assigned a number of electors, equal to the number of seats it has in the house of representatives plus its two senators. the candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives all of that state's electoral votes, with the exception of maine and nebraska, which award their electoral votes by congressional district. the electoral college was created at the constitutional convention in 1787 as a compromise between those who wanted the president to be elected by congress and those who wanted the president to be elected by a popular vote of the people. the framers of the constitution believed that the electoral college would provide a more deliberative process for electing the president and would prevent a few large states from dominating the election. however, the electoral college has proven to be an outdated and undemocratic institution. in recent years, there have been several elections in which the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election. this happened in 2000, when george w. bush won the presidency despite losing the popular vote to al gore. it also happened in 2016, when donald trump won the presidency despite losing the popular vote to hillary clinton. the electoral college gives undue power to a few small states. in the 2016 election, trump won the presidency by winning a majority of the electoral votes. however, he won only 30.6 of the popular vote. this means that a candidate can win the presidency without having the support of the majority of the american people. the electoral college also encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a small number of battleground states. in 2016, trump spent very little time campaigning in california or new york, knowing that he was unlikely to win those states. instead, he focused his efforts on a handful of battleground states, such as ohio, pennsylvania, and florida. this means that voters in many states feel like their votes don't matter. for all of these reasons, i believe that the electoral college should be abolished. i urge you to support a constitutional amendment to abolish the electoral college and elect the president by popular vote. thank you for your time and consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.002870096988235105

"the use of technology that is able to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom would be very valuable. there would be a number of benefits if there was such technology availiable. this technology would not only benefit the students in more ways than one. if schools had technology that could read the faces of students and modify the lessons, it would increase the students chances of success. in the article, dr. huang claims, a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. if the lesson was altered to improve the facial expression of the student, there is a huge chance that the student will become more engaged in the lesson, resulting in success. when a student is bored in a lesson, it is more than likely the student will not pay as much attention to it as well as they would if they were truly interested. confusion may cause frustration which would lead to a more difficult learning process. a student who is actually interested in a certain lesson has more of a chance to become excited about the lesson, making the learning experience more enjoyable and easier to learn. in the article, dr. huang says, most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. this being said, most students will more than likely not verbaly express when they dislike a certain lesson. most would show their unhappiness through facial expressions. because a teacher may not be able to fully read a students facial expression, it would be more effective if computers were availiable to read the expressions and alter the lesson for the student. technology that is able to read the facial expressions of a student would benefit the student and the teachers. the student would be more engaged in the lesson, and the teacher would have a better understanding of what grabs the attention of his or her students compared to what drives his or her students away. the new technolgy would make a students more confident their skills, leading to a better, more successful educational system.",1,1,0.9156885224960023
"the author of the challenge of exploring venus' believes that venus, earth's twin, needs to be explored. venus has very extreme conditions, but according to the author nothing us humans can't handle. with a little bit of creativity and curosity, humans can learn about venus. scientist have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on venus, but most have only lasted for a few hours. with this it is hard to gather information, but why would scientists even want to send spacecrafts to it if they think there is no chance of anyone ever living there? in the article it states, astonomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system. a long time ago, venus could have supported various forms of life. if it could then, than maybe there is a chance in the future for it to. venus conditions are dangerous, but the author says we can find ways around them. for example, in the story, it states, imagine a blimp like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape. having a vehicle stay out of the high pressure, high temperature area could be a safe alternative to explore venus. the only issue with it would be that peering out of a ship can only provide the scietists with limited information on the ground conditions. nasa is very creative and has started creating electronics made of silicon carbide so they can withstand venus's conditions. for example, in the story it states, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. the spacecrafts that were previously sent there only lasted hours, so nasa is making improvements. hopefully, nasa can continue on this road to improving and one day get humans to venus safely. curiosity killed the cat is a famous saying. if we do not explore venus now, human curiosity will lead us to many equally or more dangerous things. the author supports their idea very well and makes multiple vaild points explaining why we should become a little more creative so we can explore venus now. there would no longer be any curosity about it, making it safer.",1,1,0.9999427510237996
"school uniforms have become a highly debated subject in recent years. many people believe that requiring students to wear uniforms would be beneficial to the school environment, while others suggest that it would be a violation of student's rights. in this essay, i will discuss the pros and cons of implementing a school uniform policy along with my own opinion on whether or not wearing uniforms should be mandatory in schools today. the most common argument for making school uniforms compulsory is that they promote discipline among students and prevent them from engaging in any inappropriate behavior such as bullying or gang activity. wearing the same clothes eliminates differences between groups within the school, which can lead to better cooperation between students from different backgrounds and create an overall more cohesive learning environment. uniforms also save parents time and money since their children don t need to worry about what outfit they ll wear each day something particularly important for families with limited resources who might not otherwise afford new clothes every season. additionally, having all students dressed alike reduces distractions so teachers can focus their attention on teaching rather than supervising wardrobe choices. on the other hand, some people argue that mandating uniforms restricts freedom of expression by preventing kids from expressing themselves through clothing choices an especially important right during adolescence when personal identity is being formed. furthermore, forcing everyone into identical outfits may also send messages of conformity instead fostering individuality or creativity among younger generations qualities many employers value when hiring new employees later down the road! finally cost could potentially be another issue if families cannot easily purchase these items for their children leading them feeling embarrassed amongst peers due to lack of fitting in with appropriate attire for example. . in my opinion, there are both advantages and disadvantages associated with making school uniforms mandatory however at times it seems necessary because it promotes discipline among students and prevents them from distracting one another either consciously or unconsciously . it ultimately creates a sense of belonging within classrooms which allows teachers switch quickly between lesson plans without having",0,0,0.0005160381234060895

"dress codes r real important in skools. they help create a good lernin environment. i think they r beneficial. first, dress codes help students focus on their work. if students wearin baggy pants and tank tops, they might get distracted and start thinkin about stuff that has nothin to do with learnin. but if they wearin nice clothes, they feel more professional and focused. my friend sarah wore a nice blouse and skirt to skool one day, and she said she felt like a grown up and was able to pay more attention in class. second, dress codes promote respect. if students wearin sloppy clothes, it looks like they dont care about themselves or their education. but if they wearin nice clothes, it shows they respect themselves and their teachers. my teacher, mrs. johnson, always wears nice clothes, and it makes me want to respect her more. third, dress codes can help prevent bullyin. if students wearin the same kinda clothes, it helps them feel like they belong and reduces the chance of them bein picked on. my friend tom was wearin a nice shirt and tie one day, and some kids made fun of him. but then they realized that they were bein mean, and they apologized. finally, dress codes can prepare students for the real world. when we graduate, we gonna have to dress up for work and interviews. so, if we practice dressin up in skool, it will be easier for us when we get older. my dad always says, dress for the job you want, not the job you have. in conclusion, dress codes r beneficial to the skool environment. they help students focus, promote respect, prevent bullyin, and prepare us for the real world. so, skools should keep implementin dress codes to create a positive lernin environment.",0,0,0.0010270261789282035
"the phantom face on mars many people see mysteries where there are none. the so called face on mars is one such case. while its pareidolic shape understandably sparks imaginations, scientific evidence tells us the landform is simply a natural rock formation, not an artifact of aliens. several facts support this conclusion. firstly, newer photos from 1998 show the face has eroded away over time due to processes like wind erosion. if aliens carved it, why would natural environmental factors wear it down? its features have changed and faded without purpose or design. secondly, similar mesa landforms on mars, devoid of faces, follow the same wind created patterns as the face. scientists understand the geological mechanisms that shape rocks into sheer cliffsides and mesas under martian conditions. the face fits these natural profiles. some argue its symmetrical qualities prove its artificial nature. however, symmetrical rock formations occur throughout our own planet through geologic uplift and weathering alone. symmetry does not require an intelligent hand. the face's symmetry has more plausible scientific explanations than alien sculptors. further, subsequent high resolution images reveal its features are asymmetrical up close, contradicting claims of artificial precision. while the human tendency to see faces remains intriguing, extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. no evidence substantiates carved or constructed origins for this mesa. ultimately, understanding comes through facts, not fantasies. the face on mars is best understood as a chance product of ordinary geological processes on another world, not alien visitation. natural explanations have held up under scientific scrutiny, while alien sculptors remain in the realm of unproven hypothesis. for these compelling reasons, most experts agree the phantom face is merely a natural rock formation.",0,0,0.1774507653749857
"dear senator, i am writing to express my view that the united states should change from the electoral college system to electing the president by a popular vote of the american people. while the electoral college was established by the founders with the aim of having each state be represented, i believe the popular vote better reflects the will of the citizens. one argument often made in favor of keeping the electoral college is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign in more states. however, research shows that candidates tend to focus their efforts only on swing states that could vote either way. this means that the vast majority of states receive little attention, and their citizens feel ignored. a popular vote system would encourage candidates to appeal to voters across the entire nation, not just selective swing states. it would make every vote truly equal and give voice to more americans. it is also argued that without the electoral college, small states would be neglected. yet a popular vote does not diminish any state's role. candidates would still try to earn support from voters in all 50 states. some may express concern that large, population heavy states would dominate national elections, but candidates would still need to form a majority coalition including many other states to win. a national popular vote does not advantage large states alone. most importantly, the popular vote aligns with the fundamental principle that in a democracy, the winner should be who receives the most individual votes nationally. while the electoral college process usually results in the candidate who earned the most votes winning, it is possible for the candidate with fewer national votes to take office. this undermines the idea of one person, one vote. in an era where we have grown accustomed to seeing vote tallies nationally, the electoral college system can seem unnecessarily complex and indirect. for these reasons, i believe changing to a national popular vote would strengthen our democracy and ensure that every american's ballot carries the same weight in selecting their president. the will of the national majority should be what determines the outcome each election. i encourage you to support electoral reform to implement this fairer system. thank you for your consideration.",0,0,0.0025966949185838345
"young people are important resources to their countries. but governments may ignore some problems faced by young people in running the country. do you agree or disagree? there are a number of reasons why governments may ignore the problems faced by young people. one reason is that young people are often not fully informed about the issues surrounding their country. many young people do not have the opportunity to grow up in a democracy and see their country through the lens of the young. governments may also views young people as a burden, instead of an asset. for example, some young people may be afraid to speak up because they may be labeled as outhright. in some cases, young people may be not given the opportunity to make a difference in their country. for example, the united states spends more money on education than any other country, but only 25 of the population is under the age of 25. this leaves a large opportunity for young people to make an impact on their country and make it a better place. all of these reasons make it difficult for governments to ignore the problems faced by young people. it is important for governments to take notice of the problems faced by young people in order to better address them.",0,0,0.0008278162801501137

"hi, i'm a grade 7 student and i think that summer projects should be a mix of both teacher designed and student designed. firstly, teacher designed projects are good because they help us learn new things and review what we learned during the school year. for example, our teacher might give us a project on fractions to make sure we don't forget how to add, subtract, multiply and divide them. this way, we can keep practicing and become more confident in our math skills. plus, teachers know what we need to work on the most, so they can design projects that will help us the most. on the other hand, student designed projects are also important because they allow us to be creative and choose topics that we are interested in. for instance, if i'm really into science, i might want to design a project that involves researching a specific animal and creating a presentation about it. this way, i get to learn something new while also having fun. it also helps us learn how to work independently and take responsibility for our own learning. i think a mix of both types of projects would be the best because it gives us the benefits of both. we get to learn new things and practice what we already know, while also having the freedom to choose topics that we enjoy. it's like having the best of both worlds! in conclusion, summer projects should be a mix of teacher designed and student designed. this way, we can continue learning and growing during our break, while also having fun and being creative.",0,0,9.550777120867284e-05

"there are a few reasons io believe thai understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning faces. first, in order io understand ideas and concepts, students need io have a firm grasp of the faces. second, ideas and concepts are what allow students io apply their knowledge io new situations. finally, ideas and concepts are more likely io be remembered than faces. to begin with, in order io understand ideas and concepts, students need io have a firm grasp of the faces. this is because ideas and concepts are built on a foundation of faces. for example, students might have a difficult time understanding the concept of photosynthesis if they do noi first understand the related faces, such as the face thai plans use sunlight io convert carbon dioxide into oxygen. in other words, students need io learn the faces before they can hope io understand the ideas and concepts. second, ideas and concepts are what allow students io apply their knowledge io new situations. this is because ideas and concepts represent the higher level understanding thai students need in order io be able io use their knowledge in new and different ways. for example, a student who understands the concept of photosynthesis will be able io apply thai knowledge io a new situation, such as understanding how plans are affected by air pollution. in contrast, a student who only knows the faces about photosynthesis will be limited io regurgitating those faces in the same situation each time. finally, ideas and concepts are more likely io be remembered than faces. this is because ideas and concepts are typically more interesting and more meaningful than faces. for example, a student is more likely io remember the concept of photosynthesis than the individual faces related io photosynthesis. in addition, ideas and concepts are more likely io be recalled because they are typically associated with other ideas and concepts. for example, a student who understands the concept of photosynthesis is likely io also understand the concept of the water cycle. in conclusion, while faces are certainly important, understanding ideas and concepts is more important. this is because ideas and concepts are built on a foundation of faces, they allow students io apply their knowledge io new situations, and they are more likely io be remembered.",0,0,0.002360708075672145

"successful people are not afraid to try new things and take risks. they know that in order to achieve their goals, they need to be constantly learning and expanding their horizons. this willingness to experiment and take chances is what sets them apart from others who are content with doing what they are already good at. for example, when steve jobs was starting apple, he was willing to take a risk and create a new type of computer that no one had ever seen before. this risk paid off, and apple became a successful company. similarly, when mark zuckerberg started facebook, he was willing to experiment with different ways to get people to use the site. he tried things that other people said would never work, and as a result, facebook became the largest social media site in the world. successful people are not afraid to try new things because they know that failure is a part of the learning process. they understand that if they don t take risks, they will never achieve anything great. in fact, many of the most successful people in the world have failed multiple times before they finally achieved success. for example, j. k. rowling was rejected by 12 publishers before her book, harry potter and the philosopher s stone, was finally published. and richard branson, the founder of virgin group, has had more than his share of failed businesses. but these failures have not stopped them from trying again and again until they finally achieved success. successful people also know that risk taking is not always about taking big risks. sometimes, it s about taking small risks that can lead to big rewards. for example, if you want to start a business, you might be willing to risk your savings to do so, but you might also be willing to risk your time by starting the business on the side while you are still working a day job. in conclusion, successful people are not afraid to try new things and take risks. they know that in order to achieve their goals, they need to be constantly learning and expanding their horizons. this willingness to experiment and take chances is what sets them apart from others who are content with doing what they are already good at.",0,0,0.00905010798707952
"the great philosopher, waldo emerson, once said unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you well never grow . this statement bs profound and true, as bt acknowledges the importance of pushing ourselves further towards our greatest potential. in order to grow, we must be willing to go beyond our comfort zone and traverse unfamiliar territory in order to broaden our horizons and personal development. for example, bf i washed to become a professional software engineer, i would need to take on a variety of different tasks far beyond what i already know. without continuing to learn and develop my knowledge and skills beyond what i am already comfortable with, i would not be able to progress in my career in any meaningful way. taking on challenges in a specific area forces us to think critically, refining our existing skillet and learning new ones that well support our growth. emerson's statement also applies to our personal lives. whether bt s in our hobbies, our relationships, or even our daily habits, bf we keep doing the same thing over and over again, we won t experience growth or improve our individual circumstances. we need to challenge ourselves to step up and take on something new and exciting that well encourage us to think outside the box. trying something beyond our current capabilities well develop our confidence and skill, allowing us to develop and reach our potential. in summary, waldo emerson s statement of unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you well never grow bs profound and true. to grow, we must be willing to step outside of our comfort zone and take on unfamiliar challenges. whether bt s professionally or personally, by pushing our boundaries, we well be setting ourselves up for personal and professional betterment.",0,0,4.504064262111534e-05
"i believe that the use of animals in scientific research is unethical and unjustifiable. animals, just like humans, have the right to live their lives without being subjected to pain and suffering, and using the for our own benefits is not only wrong but also inhumane. first, it is morally wrong to use animals for scientific experiments because they cannot give their consent. animals do not have a voice to express their opinion on whether they want to participate in such experiments or not. therefore, it is unethical to force the into situations that day hard or even kill the. moreover, animals are often subjected to excruciating pain and suffering during scientific research. for instance, in cosmetic and pharmaceutical testing, animals are often subjected to skin irritation, blindness, and even death. such cruelty should not be allowed in any ford of research, as it is morally wrong to inflict pain and suffering on innocent creatures. in addition to these reasons, it is also worth noting that animals are not always accurate models for human conditions. many tides, results food animal testing do not translate to humans, which makes it an unreliable method of conducting research. for instance, a recent study showed that 90 of drugs that were proven to be effective in animal testing failed in human clinical trials. this indicates that animal testing is not an accurate measure of how drugs will work on humans. therefore, i strongly believe that the use of animals in scientific research should be abolished. there are any alternative methods, such as computer modeling and in vitro testing, that can be used to conduct research without harding animals. these alternatives are not only humane but also more accurate and cost effective. in conclusion, we should all advocate for the end of animal testing in scientific research. it's tide for us to take action and protect the rights of animals, who cannot speak for themselves. we dust remember that our actions have consequences, and using animals for our own benefits is not justified.",0,0,0.007871714953305702

"when it comes to advice, it's very important that you are getting the correct advice. receiving wrong advice can be a vital mistake in whatever you're doing. asking only one individual can lead you to the wrong advice. one person limits yourself to the knowledge and experience you could've received from various people. that is why it's very important to listen to multiple inputs on how other people feel. receiving advice from one person is not always the smartest decision. asking someone who lacks knowledge in that topic has a high chance of giving you wrong information. asking multiple people who have knowledge about that topic will most likely give great advice. multiple people with great knowledge will help you have the retain the most knowledge. only one person limits the advice you get from experienced people. asking a person that is not very experienced will not help as much than various people with experience. even if only one person is very experienced, two experienced people will help more. two minds are greater than one! listening to multiple opinions for advice is important for advice. only getting one opinion is not smart. different opinions can help you make smart choices. multiple people can give you different inputs that you can narrow down by yourself. giving yourself options to choose from will help you make the better choice. all of these reasons are reasons why people shouldnt just seek one person for advice. receiving advice from various people with knowledge and experience is the best way to go. listening to multiple opinions will help you choose the best option.",1,1,0.901091631317528

"drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. there are several important reasons for this. first and foremost, cell phone use is a dangerous distraction for drivers. texting, talking, or even handling a phone takes a driver's eyes and attention away from the road. this decreases their awareness of their surroundings and ability to react quickly to hazards. several studies have shown that driving while distracted by a phone is as dangerous as or worse than driving drunk. even hands free use can be distracting as drivers focus on their conversations instead of driving. second, cell phone use increases the risk of accidents. talking or texting on a phone has been shown to reduce the amount of brain activity a driver dedicates to actually operating the vehicle. this taxes their mental workload and slows reaction times, making accidents and collisions far more likely. the cdc reports that cell phone use is involved in around 1.6 million auto accidents annually in the u.s. alone. third, cell phone use endangers more than just the user. when a driver is distracted, they put everyone on the road at risk other motorists, passengers, pedestrians, cyclists. one moment of inattention can have devastating consequences for others through no fault of their own. distracted driving from cell phone use has been blamed for countless accidents that resulted in serious injuries or loss of life. in conclusion, allowing any cell phone use while driving compromises safety on our roads. the risks of accidents, injuries and death far outweigh any convenience cell phones may provide. distracted driving terminates in tragedy all too often. for the welfare of everyone who shares the road, cell phones should remain stowed and hands free while operating a vehicle. safety must come before all other concerns.",0,0,0.23339864348394215

"dear principal, i am writing to express my opinion on the possible policy change that would require students to have at least a grade b average to participate in sports or other activities. as a student in grade 11, i understand the importance of academic success, but i also believe that extracurricular activities play a vital role in shaping our educational experience. i argue against requiring a grade b average to participate in sports or other activities. firstly, not all students are academically inclined, and some may struggle to meet the minimum grade requirement. by denying them the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities, we could be discouraging them from staying involved in school and potentially causing them to fall behind academically. secondly, extracurricular activities provide an unique opportunity for students to develop their interests, learn new skills, and build social relationships. by limiting participation to only those with high grades, we could be depriving some students of these valuable experiences. additionally, participating in sports or other activities can help students develop time management skills, which are essential for academic success. furthermore, requiring a grade b average could potentially create a negative environment among students. students may feel pressured to prioritize academics over extracurricular activities, leading to an unhealthy balance between the two. this could result in burnout, stress, and decreased motivation among students. lastly, i believe that there are alternative ways to ensure academic success without limiting participation in extracurricular activities. for example, teachers and faculty could provide additional academic support and resources for students who are struggling. this would allow all students to participate in sports or other activities while still maintaining a focus on academic achievement. in conclusion, i respectfully argue against requiring a grade b average to participate in sports or other activities. i believe that all students should have the opportunity to participate, regardless of their academic performance. i hope that you well consider my viewpoint and the potential impact that this policy change could have on all students. sincerely, your name",0,0,1.1587111536118452e-05

"there are several reasons why the government should not put money on building theaters and sports stadiums. one reason is that these investments can only be made if there is a guarantee that the money will be returned. most stadiums and theaters only generate revenue once the event is held. if the government were to invest in these types of investments without knowing whether or not the investments would be profitable, it would be difficult to determine whether or not the investments should be made. another reason why the government should not put money into these types of investments is because the investments can have a negative impact on the economy. if the investments are not profitable, the government may have to face financial difficulties. this could lead to the government reducing it's funding for other programs, which could have a negative impact on the economy. lastly, the investments can be dangerous. if the investments are not successful, the government may be forced to face the wrath of the public. this could have a negative impact on the government s credibility and the government s ability to make future investments.",0,0,0.004701380272368196

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular tote. the electoral college is an outdated system that is no longer reflective of the will of the people. in recent years, we hate seen several elections in which the candidate who won the popular tote lost the election due to the electoral college. this is undemocratic and unfair to the millions of people who toted for the losing candidate. there are several reasons why the electoral college should be abolished. first, it is not a fair system. the electoral college g tes more power to towers in small states than to towers in large states. this is because each state has the same number of electoral totes as it has members of congress, regardless of its population. this means that a tower in wyoming has 3.6 times more toting power than a tower in california. second, the electoral college leads to candidates focusing their campaigns on a few swing states. this means that candidates often ignore the needs of towers in other states, which is unfair to those towers. third, the electoral college has led to several controversial elections in recent years. in 2000, george w. bush won the presidency even though he lost the popular tote to al gore. this was due to the fact that bush won the electoral totes of florida, which had a very close election. in 2016, donald trump won the presidency even though he lost the popular tote to hillary clinton. this was due to the fact that trump won the electoral totes of several small states, such as michigan, pennsylvania, and wisconsin. i believe that the best way to ensure that the president of the united states is elected by the will of the people is to abolish the electoral college and elect the president by popular tote. this would be a fair and democratic system that would ensure that all towers hate an equal voice in the election. i urge you to support a constitutional amendment that would abolish the electoral college and elect the president by popular tote. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.07066493692893383
"the debate about whether children should learn to compete or cooperate is a polarizing one. on one hand, competition can encourage children to strive for excellence, while on the other hand, cooperation can teach children important social skills. ultimately, i believe that children should be taught both to compete and to cooperate. competition can benefit children in a variety of ways. first, it can help to develop their goal oriented mindset. when children are encouraged to compete, they learn to set goals and work to achieve them. this can help them stay motivated and focused on their tasks. additionally, competition can foster a sense of accomplishment when children succeed at a task or achieve a goal. this can build their self esteem, leading to increased confidence in their ability to succeed. finally, competition can also help children learn to take risks and push themselves out of their comfort zones, which can be beneficial in the long run. at the same time, cooperation is just as important for children s development. learning to cooperate with others teaches children important social skills that can help them build relationships and work with others. this is especially important in today s world, where teamwork and collaboration are essential for success. additionally, cooperation can help children learn to compromise and resolve conflicts, which is key for successful communication. finally, working together can help children develop empathy and understanding for different perspectives, which can lead to greater tolerance and acceptance of diversity. in conclusion, both competition and cooperation are essential for children s development. competition can help children build goal oriented mindsets and foster a sense of accomplishment, while cooperation can teach them important social skills and help them develop empathy and understanding. ultimately, both should be encouraged in children s upbringing.",0,0,7.727961251077577e-06
"the legalization of marijuana has been a topic that has been argued about for years. some people think it should be legalized, while others think it should stay illegal. in my opinion, marijuana should be legalized. first of all, marijuana is not a dangerous drug. it's not addictive like other drugs, such as heroin or cocaine. you can't overdose on it, unlike other drugs. it's also not as harmful as tobacco or alcohol, which are both legal. in fact, marijuana has many health benefits. it can help with chronic pain, nausea, and even some mental health disorders. another reason marijuana should be legalized is that it would help reduce crime. if marijuana were legal, people wouldn't have to resort to illegal means to get it. this would reduce the number of drug dealers and the amount of money they make. it would also reduce the number of people in jail for marijuana related crimes. additionally, legalizing marijuana would help the economy. if marijuana were legal, it would create a new industry, which would create jobs and generate revenue. this money could be used for important things like education and healthcare. finally, marijuana is already widely used. according to a survey, over 40 of americans have tried marijuana. this means that a significant portion of the population is already using it, even though it's illegal. by legalizing it, we could regulate it and make sure it's safe for people to use. in conclusion, marijuana should be legalized because it's not dangerous, it would reduce crime, it would help the economy, and it's already widely used. it's time for us to recognize the benefits of marijuana and make it legal.",0,0,0.0023411236903227283

"schools should allow students to design their own summer projects rather than having teachers design mandatory assignments. student designed projects are more engaging and better promote continued learning over the break. when students are given the freedom to choose their own summer project topics based on their own interests, they are far more motivated to dedicate time and effort into completing meaningful work. for example, a student interested in art may choose to spend their summer practicing different techniques or learning about famous artists. meanwhile, a student passionate about science could opt to conduct simple experiments or research emerging fields of study. by choosing projects related to their personal passions and hobbies, students are intrinsically motivated to dive deeper into subjects they genuinely find interesting. in contrast, teacher designed assignments risk feeling like more homework assigned over the summer. if students are given mandatory topics and guidelines by their teachers that may not align with their interests, they are less likely to engage fully with the work. it is unrealistic to expect students to dedicate as much time and energy into completing projects they have little personal investment in. forcing students to adhere to teacher guidelines for summer work also limits creativity and personal exploration of topics outside the regular curriculum. finally, allowing students to self direct their summer learning through projects of their own choosing fosters independence and responsibility. by setting their own goals and managing their own schedules without constant teacher oversight, students develop valuable self learning skills. they learn to pursue knowledge and challenges according to their aspirations, with the understanding that lifelong learning does not stop once school lets out for the summer break. overall, student designed summer projects are a more effective way to keep students engaged in learning outside a traditional classroom setting.",0,0,0.0012886744360387995
"the facial action coding system facs is a revolutionary technology that allows computers to identify human emotions. while this technology has the potential to revolutionize various fields, its application in educational settings is a topic of debate. the article making mona lisa smile presents arguments for and against the use of facs in classrooms. after careful consideration, i believe that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. firstly, the human brain is capable of naturally performing complex emotional calculations, rendering emotion detecting software unnecessary in environments where human interaction is key, such as classrooms. as technology expert nick d'alto notes, humans can intuitively gauge emotions through facial expressions. teachers, who are trained to observe and respond to students' emotions, can effectively sense and respond to student emotions without the need for technology. secondly, the deployment of emotion recognition software in classrooms raises profound privacy concerns. the facs system lacks the capacity to understand the underlying causes of emotions, and its application in a diverse classroom setting could lead to invasive scrutiny of students' private emotional states. this could potentially exacerbate their distress, highlighting the need for a careful balance between technological advancement and the protection of individual privacy. furthermore, the implementation of emotion detection technology in classrooms is impractical and costly. the feasibility of adapting teaching methods in real time to maintain student engagement is questionable, and the cost of equipping each student with a personalized emotion detecting computer is prohibitive. lastly, the article emphasizes the importance of human centric teaching methods and the need to approach technological integration in education with caution and respect for privacy. the value of human touch in education, where emotional understanding and connection are paramount, cannot be replaced by technology. in conclusion, while the facial action coding system is a fascinating technological advancement, its application in classrooms is not valuable. the costs, both in terms of privacy and practicality, outweigh the potential benefits. instead, we should focus on human centric teaching methods that prioritize emotional understanding and connection. as we continue to integrate technology into education, we must do so with caution and respect for privacy, ensuring that we maintain the human touch that is essential to learning.",0,0,0.0001383550103365493

"in the article driverless cars are coming, the author argues for and against the development of these cars. as a tenth grade student, i am intrigued by the concept of self driving vehicles, but i believe that there are more drawbacks than benefits to driverless cars. firstly, the author points out that current technology is not advanced enough to handle complex driving scenarios at higher speeds. this means that even though driverless cars are reliable for simple functions at speeds up to 25 mph, they still require human intervention and constant vigilance. this raises the question of their practicality if a driver still needs to be actively engaged, are these cars truly driverless? in my opinion, the answer is no. if the driver still needs to be alert at all times, then what is the point of having a driverless car? it is just an unnecessary expense. secondly, the author discusses the privacy concerns associated with driverless cars. to ensure driver engagement, some manufacturers are considering installing cameras to monitor drivers. the thought of being constantly watched and evaluated by a manufacturer is unsettling for many and could lead to increased stress and distracted driving. i agree with this point entirely. i would not feel comfortable driving a car that was constantly monitoring my every move. it is an invasion of privacy, and it is not necessary. finally, the economic implications of transitioning to driverless cars are substantial. these vehicles require compatible infrastructure, notably'smart roads' that can communicate with them. such upgrades would be exorbitantly expensive, and it's unclear who would bear these costs. additionally, these smart roads would need to be universally compatible with all types of vehicles, both driverless and traditional. the logistics and financial burden of such a transition are daunting. in my opinion, it is not worth the cost and effort to build a new infrastructure for driverless cars when traditional cars work perfectly fine. in conclusion, i argue that the development of driverless cars is not worth the cost, effort, and privacy concerns associated with them. the focus should be on refining existing technologies rather than pushing for a futuristic ideal that doesn't yet align with practical, economic, or privacy related concerns.",0,0,0.02231955538557931

"title car free cities an environmentally sustainable future? introduction imagine a world without cars. a world where cities are designed with the environment in mind, where people rely on public transportation, walking, and bicycling instead of personal vehicles. this concept might seem farfetched, but some cities worldwide have already embraced the idea of car free living. copenhagen, denmark one example of a car free city is copenhagen, denmark. this city has been consistently ranked among the world's most liveable cities due to its emphasis on sustainability. copenhagen's public transportation network, consisting of buses, trains, and bicycles, makes it incredibly easy for people to move around the city without using cars. in fact, more than 35 of the population commute to work by bicycle. the city government has implemented various policies to encourage cycling. they have invested heavily in bike infrastructure, including dedicated bike lanes, bike racks, and secure bicycle storage facilities. copenhagen also offers free bikes to tourists as a way to promote eco friendly transportation and encourage locals to adopt a similar lifestyle. additionally, copenhagen has implemented a congestion charge, which requires drivers to pay a fee to enter the city center during rush hour. the purpose of this charge is to reduce traffic congestion and pollution, as well as encourage people to use alternative modes of transport. copenhagen's success in becoming a car free city serves as an inspiration for other cities worldwide. by focusing on sustainability, investing in public transportation infrastructure, and implementing policies that discourage car use, copenhagen demonstrates that it is possible to create a greener, more environmentally friendly urban environment. conclusion in conclusion, the concept of car free cities may seem challenging, but with cities like copenhagen leading the way, it is possible that car free living could become more prevalent and sustainable. as more cities embrace eco friendly initiatives and prioritize public transportation, we might one day see a world where personal vehicles are no longer a necessity.",0,0,0.02130319391267807
"as the technology of today continues to rapidly evolve, so does the field of augmented reality ar . ar is a computer generated simulation that combines real world and virtual elements to create an immersive experience. this innovative technology has become increasingly popular in recent years, with its application ranging from gaming to navigation. to explore this trend further, this essay will examine the advantages and disadvantages of using ar for navigation purposes as well as how it may affect our lives in the future. one major advantage of using ar for navigating unfamiliar places is that it provides detailed information about a given area without requiring users to carry physical maps or gps devices. for example, if you are visiting a new city, rather than trying to find your way around by asking strangers or studying paper maps, you can use an app such as google maps or waze which will provide you with turn by turn directions based on your current location. additionally, some applications also offer points of interest within walking distance such as restaurants and bars which can help make exploring more enjoyable and efficient. as a result, this form of high technological convenience not only allows people to get where they need quicker but also helps them discover new places along the way that they would have never known existed otherwise. on the other hand there are potential drawbacks associated with relying too heavily on ar for navigational purposes as well. first off since these systems rely on digital data provided over wi fi or cellular networks they require strong connections in order function properly which means if someone happens to be outside their service coverage area then they will no longer be able receive updated map data until reconnected again later on down the road making navigation much more difficult especially when traveling through rural areas with weaker signals present . moreover due its reliance being dependent upon global positioning satellites if one should ever lose access these satellites due something like solar flares then all gps capabilities could potentially be wiped out entirely leaving people completely lost at sea figuratively speaking . lastly there s always worry",0,0,0.000986872767430267

"limiting car usage for a greener future there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage and promoting more sustainable transportation options. doing so can significantly improve our environment and quality of life. reducing the number of vehicles on the road would help lower greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. cars are a major contributor to climate change since they emit carbon dioxide simply by being driven. cutting back on driving could slow global warming and make our cities more breathable. the passage notes that transportation accounts for over 25 of greenhouse gas emissions in many countries. even minor reductions in car trips, if adopted widely, would cumulatively remove substantial amounts of harmful pollutants from the atmosphere. shifting modes of transport would also ease traffic congestion in many urban areas. major cities around the world are experiencing worsening traffic as more people commute by car each year. the passage states that roads in some cities are so clogged that drivers spend weeks of their lives stuck in traffic jams. encouraging alternatives like public transit, biking, and walking could clear overloaded roads and cut travel times. with less vehicles clogging up streets, emergency response times would also improve. aside from environmental benefits, limiting car usage promotes active living and community interaction. getting around by bike or on foot provides mild exercise to stay healthy. the passage notes that lack of physical activity has contributed to rising obesity rates. non motorized travel also encourages chance meetings between neighbors, which can foster stronger social bonds and a better sense of belonging within neighborhoods. overall, curbing vehicular traffic in favor of green transportation options can create a more livable, people centered environment in our cities and towns. informing citizens about these benefits could gain support for limiting individual car trips through smart urban planning and sustainable policies. by appealing to self interest as well as environmental stewardship, such programs aim to replace some car journeys with walking, cycling and shared public transport for a greener, more convenient future.",0,0,0.013808877289778112
"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my strong support for eliminating the electoral college. i believe that this outdated system is no longer representative of the american people, and that it is time for us to elect our president by popular vote. the electoral college was created in the 18th century, when the united states was a very different country. at that time, communication and transportation were much slower, and it was difficult for people in different parts of the country to now what was going on. the electoral college was designed to give more power to the smaller states, so that they would not be ignored by the larger states. however, the electoral college is no longer necessary. we now have a much faster and more efficient way of communicating and transporting information. there is no reason why the people of california should have less of a say in who becomes president than the people of wyoming. in fact, the electoral college is actually harmful to democracy. it often leads to candidates focusing their attention on a handful of swing states, while ignoring the needs of the rest of the country. this is because the electoral college gives disproportionate power to the smaller states. a candidate can win the popular vote by millions of votes, but still lose the election if they don't win enough electoral votes. this happened in the 2000 election, when al gore won the popular vote but lost the election to george w. bush. this has happened two other times in american history, and it could happen again in the future. it is time for us to get rid of the electoral college and elect our president by popular vote. this would be the fairest and most democratic way to choose our leader. i urge you to support this important reform. than you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.04882649089536865
"in recent years, much research has been done to determine whether true self esteem comes from praise or achievement. some studies have indicated that children who are regularly praised for improvement or progress experience higher self esteem however, this is not the same as true self esteem. true self esteem can only be derived from a sense of accomplishment or success. giving praise for deficient work can have a negative effect on a student's learning. in these cases, the student is not being held to a high enough standard and has little incentive to strive for excellence. if praise is used in this manner, it may actually do more harm than good by instilling in the student a false sense of achievement and security. while praise can be an important factor in a student's overall success, it cannot be the sole source of true self esteem. achievement is ultimately the more effective source of true self esteem, as it is based on hard work and tangible results. ultimately, both praise and achievement can be essential tools for helping students develop self esteem, but ultimately achieving success is the best way for students to gain a true sense of self worth.",0,0,1.2719433166986697e-05
"i believe using this technology to read students emotions and expressions is going to be very useful. i agree with the use of this technology to read students emotional expressions. furthermore, i believe it is important to, as a teacher and parents to notice when the student or child is not doing fine. for example in paragraph 5 the text says . you probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on his her face . this text shows that in a school with a lot of kids you can easily tell when one is not in a good mood and when one is. it is going to be much easier finding out how someone feels when having a big technical device help you as well. a statement from paragraph 6 it says a classroom computer could recognize when is a student is becoming confused or bored . this helps the teacher know which of her classmates understands. another thing i would like to add is what if a student is thinking of something bad or personal and the device still reads his emotions? to me don't think that's appropriate. let's agree to disagree by this statement they even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one . this text the author stated was given in the middle between paragraphs 7 and 8. someone can be feeling down but with something private going on in their lives they might even tend to hide their emotions and not say a word i mean it has happened. besides, there's a difference from acting and emotions. however, let's get back to the agreement section. in paragraph 8 the author states according to the feedback .... moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them . to matter how your feeling there's going to be a way to hide your emotions when you don't want them to be seen or another thing, you can express them. either way it's good for your muscles. from this article making mona lisa smile i agreed on using this technology to read students emotions and expressions is useful. perhaps further on in the future this type of technology will be used more and will be advanced as well.",1,1,0.9998018584136722

"dear state senator s name , i am writing to you in regards to the electoral college. as a student in 9th grade, i am learning about government and the election process, and the role of the electoral college is a crucial component that requires attention. in my opinion, i believe that the electoral college should not be abolished but instead revised. firstly, the electoral college was put in place by the founding fathers as a way to ensure that smaller states have a say in who the president would be. without the electoral college, smaller states would be overlooked, and only a few populous states would have the power to decide the election. another advantage of the electoral college is that it prevents fraud in elections. by requiring an absolute minimum number of votes, it becomes very difficult for one group to rig the election, thus ensuring a secure and fair election. additionally, the electoral college helps to maintain the balance of power. with both small and large states represented, it helps to ensure that the president is accountable to all states, and not just the populous ones. however, there are some disadvantages to the electoral college that also need to be considered. for example, there have been instances where a candidate has won the popular vote but lost the election due to the way electoral votes are allocated. this can create a sense of resentment among voters, who feel that their vote did not count. in conclusion, i believe that the electoral college should be revised to better serve the needs of the country. the system can still be maintained but modified to ensure that it accurately reflects the popular opinion. by doing so, we can ensure a fair, secure, inclusive, and democratic process that reflects the will of the american people. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.00020622109254396091

"the face on mars a naturally formed landform many people speculate that the famous face on mars was sculpted by intelligent lifeforms. however, evidence from nasa scientists strongly supports that it is simply a naturally occurring landform. the so called face is actually an optical illusion caused by light and shadows interacting with hills and ridges in mars' cydonia region. one key claim is that the structure of the face does not reflect intelligent design. upon closer examination with improved cameras on later nasa missions, it is clear the hills that make up the facial features are uneven and asymmetrical. if the face were artificially created, one would expect precise symmetry. however, the sloping terrain shows signs of natural erosion over geological time. wind, weather and small changes in topography can contribute random streaks and shadows that mimic facial features from certain angles. additional evidence comes from comparisons with analogous landforms on earth. nasa scientists have found many examples of strange looking rock and sand formations on our own planet that resemble faces or animals. over time, natural weathering processes like water erosion, frost cracking or dust and sand movements subtly shape landscapes into bizarre yet unintended silhouettes. without context or scale, it is easy to perceive deliberate patterns that were actually random. the face shares these characteristics of strange yet natural rock and dune shapes on earth. in conclusion, while the idea of an artificially made face is intriguing, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the face on mars as being the result of natural geological processes rather than extraterrestrial intervention. continued study by nasa rovers and orbiters has disproven initial claims of artificial structures. for scientists, closer inspection revealed only an optical illusion highlighted the play of light and shadows on natural terrain. while the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe remains an open question, in this case mainstream science confirms the face is simply a trick of perception regarding an everyday martian landform.",0,0,0.1539665775529813
"using facial recognition technology like the facial action coding system facs to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom could provide some benefits but also raises serious privacy and ethical concerns. proponents might argue that facs could help teachers get a more accurate understanding of how their students are feeling during lessons. if a teacher notices many students appearing bored or confused based on their facial expressions, they may want to adjust their teaching approach to better engage the class. facs could also potentially help identify students who are struggling emotionally but not expressing it verbally. this could allow teachers to check in with students and offer support. however, there are significant downsides to consider as well. continually monitoring students' facial expressions without their consent raises major privacy issues. students should feel comfortable expressing a full range of natural emotions in class without worrying they are being watched and analyzed. many students may find this level of surveillance stressful or oppressive. it could undermine students' freedom and willingness to openly participate in class discussions. additionally, facial expression analysis is not always accurate emotions can be complex and context specific. relying on technology to interpret how students are feeling runs the risk of making incorrect assumptions. students deserve to be understood as multidimensional individuals, not reduced to algorithms or data points. overall individual conversations between teachers and students are still likely the best way for teachers to truly understand their students' engagement, comprehension and wellbeing. in conclusion, while facial recognition technology could provide teachers with some useful insights, the privacy and ethical concerns associated with its use in the classroom significantly outweigh any potential benefits. students' wellbeing and development are best supported through human interaction and understanding, not technological surveillance. for these reasons, schools should avoid adopting systems like facs for emotion reading in educational settings.",0,0,0.0001003931604189745

"car free cities have become increasingly popular in recent years, as more people recognize the numerous benefits they provide to both the environment and the quality of life for their residents. these urban areas are designed without any space for cars or parking, forcing residents to rely on alternative modes of transportation such as bicycles, public transportation, or walking. 1. reduced air pollution cars emit a large amount of greenhouse gases, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter, all of which contribute to air pollution. by removing cars from the city, car free urban areas significantly reduce air pollution levels, improving the quality of the air and the overall health of residents. 2. promotion of physical activity car free cities encourage people to walk or cycle more as their primary means of getting around. this leads to higher levels of physical activity among residents, resulting in better overall health and reduced rates of obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. 3. increased safety without cars, streets and sidewalks become safer for pedestrians and cyclists. this allows people, especially children, to move around the city more freely without worrying about traffic or accidents. 4. reduced traffic congestion without the need for cars, traffic congestion is significantly reduced in car free cities. this leads to shorter commuting times, less stress for drivers, and a more enjoyable urban experience. 5. environmental sustainability car free cities are more environmentally friendly, as they reduce the need for oil and gas consumption, which are major contributors to climate change and global warming. in conclusion, car free cities provide numerous advantages for their residents, such as improved air quality, increased physical activity, enhanced safety, reduced traffic congestion, and environmental sustainability. as the world continues to grapple with the challenges posed by climate change and urbanization, car free cities may become a more attractive and viable option for urban planning in the future.",0,0,0.0002758576526979444

"in today's fast paced and ever changing world, it can be challenging to be oneself. with the advent of new technology and constantly evolving social norms, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain one's identity and remain true to oneself. in this essay, i will explore the reasons why it is difficult to be oneself in a constantly changing world and how individuals can navigate these challenges. firstly, the constant influx of new technology has made it easier for people to connect with others across the globe. while this has its advantages, it has also made it easier for individuals to compare themselves to others and feel like they are not good enough. social media platforms, in particular, have created a culture of perfectionism where people are constantly posting pictures of their ideal lives, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self esteem. secondly, social norms are constantly changing, making it difficult for individuals to keep up. for example, what was considered acceptable behavior a few years ago may not be acceptable today. this can be seen in the way people dress, the way they communicate, and the way they express themselves. as a result, individuals may feel like they are constantly trying to fit into a mold that is constantly shifting, making it difficult to be oneself. finally, the pressure to conform to societal expectations can be overwhelming. people are often expected to have certain careers, relationships, and lifestyles based on their age, gender, race, and other factors. this can lead to individuals feeling like they are not living up to expectations and are not being true to themselves. despite these challenges, there are ways for individuals to navigate them and remain true to themselves. firstly, individuals should focus on developing their own sense of self worth and self esteem. this can be done through activities such as meditation, therapy, and self reflection. by focusing on their own values and beliefs, individuals can develop a strong sense of self that is not influenced by external factors. secondly, individuals should embrace the idea that it is okay to be different. instead of trying to fit into a mold, individuals should strive to be themselves and embrace their unique qualities. this can be done through activities such as pursuing hobbies and interests that are not mainstream and expressing oneself in a way that is authentic and true to oneself.",0,0,9.047755454239157e-08

"dear teacher name, my name is student name and i have recently heard that your are deciding weather or not to make all students perform community service. i feel that if some student don't want to help their community why force them to. if there are students that want to help make their community better you should let them keep doing what makes them happy and or proud. look at it this way if you force someone to do something they wouldn't have a positive attitude about the whole process. i think since some students give back to help their community then you and or the school should give back to them. if others see that doing something positive like cleaning up litter or even tutor elementary school kids or even staying to help a teacher with some work they may need help with, then some students might get the feeling that they really want to help. i am not saying that everyone will react in the same way but i think it would be a more calmer approach, rather than trying to force a school of kids that may not want to spend extra time of their day doing more work. it will not be easy but as a teen i would say that positive feed back can really change the way people look at things. if you put yourself in a teenager's shoes you would see that some students after school really just want a break and take a load off for a couple of minutes instead of continuing working. i think to fix this problem we need one or even to positive students took set an example for our school to encourage the others to give back to the people that live around us and help us everyday in our lives by going to what every job they may have and doing what they have to do to make our lives easier and better. thank you for your time and i hope you take my ideas into consideration. sincerely, student name",1,1,0.9971835223229895
"the electoral college, the real group of electors, is a process in which the public selected the electors. these electors then cast there votes for the president and vice president. in total there are 538 electors that participate in the process and a majority of 270 votes as necessary to elect the president and the vice president. these electors are chosen from each state, one for each member in the house of representatives plies two for yoy senators. for the district of columbia, since it's not a real state, it is awarded three electors dye to the 23rd amendment of the constitution. the time to vote for electors is every for years on the tuesday after the first monday. some people disagree with this system, by the founding fathers of the u.s. had a reason for creating the electoral college. during a campaign a candidate might have a lot of appeal in one area. for example a candidate might hae a lot of appeal in the north where there is barely any state that has more than eight electoral votes and confirm that the votes will go him. those states with very low electoral vote count will not be enough to hit 270 total votes. this drives the candidate to spread his campaign to other locations to get more votes, not only for that by because he has no reason to stay in those confirmed states. so this makes everyone across the nation feel that there votes do count. the opinion that goes against the electoral system claims that the system isn't democratic and doesn't let the people directly vote for their candidate. or another claim is that the people don't know who the electors are or what there intentions are. it is true that it's not democratic or that the electors are not well known. by the electors that the people vote for are usually picked out by the candidate or the candidates party, which are the people that yoy vote for. and by the time yoy got to vote for the electors they already are confirmed of who they are going to vote for so that gives no reason to doubt it.",1,1,0.9990577657679697

"title the revolution of driverless cars a glimpse into the future driverless cars, also known as autonomous cars, are vehicles capable of sensing their surroundings and navigating without human input. they utilize a variety of cutting edge technologies, such as gps, radar, lidar, and cameras, to navigate roads. these cars hold immense potential to revolutionize transportation and improve safety on roads. one significant advantage of driverless cars is that they have the potential to significantly reduce the occurrence of human error, which is a primary cause of car accidents. with no human driver, these vehicles eliminate the risk of distractions, fatigue, or impaired driving due to alcohol or drugs. another benefit is the potential for improved traffic flow and reduced congestion. driverless cars can communicate with each other and traffic signals, allowing for smoother and more efficient travel. this could ultimately lead to shorter travel times, less pollution, and reduced stress for drivers and commuters. driverless cars also hold great promise for enhancing mobility, particularly for individuals with disabilities or limited mobility. these vehicles can be designed with accessibility features, such as ramps, automatic doors, and wheelchair friendly interiors, making transportation more accessible for people with disabilities or reduced independence. moreover, driverless cars could contribute to a more sustainable future by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. with their advanced technology, they can optimize energy consumption and route planning, ultimately minimizing fuel consumption and carbon footprint. however, the implementation of driverless cars also presents challenges and potential risks. these vehicles must navigate complex urban environments, including pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. they must be programmed to make decisions quickly in unexpected situations. furthermore, there are concerns about cybersecurity, as these cars rely heavily on technology. hackers could potentially exploit vulnerabilities, compromising the safety and functionality of the vehicles. in conclusion, driverless cars hold the potential to revolutionize transportation by significantly enhancing safety, reducing traffic congestion, and improving mobility for individuals with disabilities. although challenges and risks must be addressed, the benefits of these vehicles make them a promising technology that will shape the future of transportation as we know it.",0,0,1.1342840066380468e-05

"dear principle, the two policies you are having to choose from are very negotiable. having no cell phones at all at school probably would not go over very well. i think that will not stop students from bringing them, and will just influence them to using them in secrecy. this policy will bring more on you, by having to punish the kids that are bringing them to school anyway. most students break this rule as it is. there is no harm in having cellular devices on school property, unless there is misuse of them, or they are distracting the class from learning. my opinion is that we should be allowed to bring our cell phones to school, and use them during free time, lunch, or passing periods. during these times we are not supervised by s teacher, or are distracting anyone from the school regulations. plus, it would be very helpful if you have an emergency, or need to get hold of someone for a ride or anything worth needing contact. you could have a rule that if your phone is not turned off during class, then you may serve a detention and get your phone taken away for the rest of school. i see my teachers on their phone constantly. they occasionally have it turned off during class, but every once in a while it will disrupt our class. if it is their job to be here, and they have their phones on, then why can't we? teachers nor students should have their phones during class, or while learning. you must keep the rules mutual. phones are a minor speed bump during our school day. we should not let it become a big deal, and just keep the use at a minimum. i believe you should make the rules that you may only turn your cell phones on during passing periods, lunch, or free time. any downtime of your day is acceptable. other than that there will be consequences. this new policy will sound fair to everyone and will keep the commotion down. students will respect that you let them use it then, let alone at all. they will most likely follow the rules. this is the best way you should go to have a fair school day. keep your options in mind. sincerely, student name",1,1,0.9988710858343757
"dear principal johnson, i am writing to express my concerns about the proposed policy change that would require students to have at least a b average in order to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities. while maintaining academic excellence is important, i do not think imposing this grade restriction is the best approach. there are a few reasons why i believe this proposed change should not be implemented. first, requiring a b average would discourage many students from getting involved. for some students, being part of a team or club is critical for their mental health, physical fitness, time management skills, and sense of belonging at our school. taking these opportunities away could be detrimental. a c average shows that students are passing their classes and making an effort, even if they struggle in some subjects. we should aim to support students' growth in all areas, not just academics. second, extracurricular activities can actually help improve students' academic performance rather than hinder it. when students are engaged in sports, clubs, or other pursuits, they learn valuable life lessons like discipline, teamwork, and leadership. this rounder education can then motivate them to work harder in their studies as well. banning students with lower grades may prevent them from gaining these benefits. finally, each student learns differently. not every talented athlete or engaged club member will achieve straight a's. a c average is often due to harder working students tackling a more challenging course load. we should celebrate their commitment and contributions to our school community rather than exclude them. in conclusion, while maintaining a balance between academics and activities is important, imposing a b average requirement is too restrictive. i ask that you reconsider this proposed policy change and keep extracurricular participation accessible to more of our diverse student body. the alternative of working with students individually seems a fairer way to both support learning and allow pursuit of passions. please let me know if you have any other questions. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.001015159405923744
"dear principal, i think we should keep the average to play sports at a c average because a c is still a passing grade and if they have a passing grade they should be eligible to play any sport or be involved in any activities they want to be in. a lot of kids have a c average and sports may be a big part of their life taking that away from them could hurt their grade even more because playing a sport is something they look forward to. i think kids need to be involved in activities. so please do not try to change the grade to play sports to a c. i know that if a kid wants to play a sport it will make him and or her bring up their grade, but it may also hurt them too. if a senior is playing basketball, and they have a c average, and they have a scholarship to a good collage for basketball, and you change the grave average to a b they would probably get the scholarship taken away and if i were them i would cry. sports can change some poor persons' life that didn't have a good house to live in and didn't have the best grades. making a change in the school policy when kids have already adjusted to them would be horrible. just like if we changed the law for driving to seven teen, and you were six teen you would be very mad because driving may be something you love to do, and you wouldn't want that taken away, so why do that to us? thanks, so please do not change it or else you may not have a good football basketball cheerleader or any other team.",1,1,0.9995370567917616

"should we have less car usage in the u.s.? the answer is yes because it could stop alot of the pollution going into the atmosphere. this could help with the green house gases going into the ozone layer and harming the earth. one reason that we should cut back on car use is because of the green house gases going into the air. in europe passenger cars are why 12 of green house gases arer from there. but the u.s. is even more responsible for the woping 50 in somer areas here. so if you were to cut back here that would be a good thing so you can cut back on the pollution. i bet if you were to use bikes instead of cars it would cut back on the 50 of green house gases here. for example take a look at newyorks bike sharing program helped out the mobile world so think about it. another reason is a lot of people really like the fact that not having cars is a great factor to the earth. just take a look in germany in the town of vauban residents of this town went from being minivan driving soccer moms to people who feel at ease because thw willingly gave up there cars. which a lot of people cannot do just like that. 70 of the families in vauban do not own cars and about 57 sold there cars just to move there which means that they all willfuly gave up there automobiles just to stay in that town and that has cut back on a lot of pollution in europe. in the passage a women says when i had a car i was always tense. i am much more happier this way. so in conclusion, i belive that giving up your car to cut back on pollution just like they did in europe is a great idea because quite frankly. i think we would be in a whole better situation if we did. this would mean a lot of the green house gases in the ozone now would not get added onto. so to me bike are a perfect way of doing this or even walking is a good substitution. so after i've explained everything are you in or out?",1,1,0.9999920390195691

"the so called face on far's is simply a natural landform and was not created by aliens. while the distinct shape of the landform resembles a human face, leading some to believe it was an artificial structure, evidence clearly shows it was formed through natural geological processes over time. the article provides strong evidence that supports the face being a natural landform rather than anything artificial. it describes how images of the landform taken at different times show erosion and changes to its appearance, proving it evolved naturally rather than being a static structure. wind and other naturally occurring weather on far's would shape and reshape sand and rocks over many years into varied formations that may occasionally resemble patterns we recognize. the face also aligns with surrounding hills and its units were deposited horizontally, as is typical for natural rock and soil layers formed by weathering. some key details further validate the natural origins of the face. its scale suggests any responsible beings would need to be impossibly large. the lack of any other artificial structures nearby makes the lone face implausible. geological analysis identifies the rocks comprising the face as typical martian sediments, not unique composites one would expect from artificial building. changes observed prove it underwent weathering with the martian climate rather than remaining pristine intact as an artificial object presumably would. in conclusion, while speculation about the face being an artificial construct created by aliens makes for an interesting hypothetical, evidence overwhelmingly shows it was formed through natural geological processes. the visible changes, alignment with surrounding terrain, and identification as typical sedimentary rocks provide strong scientific proof the so called face on far's is simply a curious but natural landform sculpted by planetary conditions, not created by extraterrestrial visitors. unless definitive evidence of artificial nature emerges, it remains rationally classified as a product of geological forces alone.",0,0,0.04984804751830334

"title exploring venus venus, the second planet from the sun, is often referred to as earth's sister planet due to its similar size and mass. however, despite some similarities, these two celestial bodies are vastly different in their composition, climate, and overall appearance. venus is a fascinating world that continues to captivate scientists and space enthusiasts alike. let's delve deeper into what makes venus such an intriguing destination. atmosphere and climate venus has an incredibly dense atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide, which is responsible for its thick cloud cover. these clouds reflect most of the sun's light back into space, making venus appear as a bright, featureless object when observed from earth. the planet's extreme greenhouse effect, fueled by the high concentrations of carbon dioxide, causes venus' temperature to soar to over 400 degrees celsius 800 degrees fahrenheit . this heat, combined with the atmospheric pressures equivalent to those found under the deepest parts of earth's oceans, creates a hostile environment where life, as we know it, is virtually impossible. surface features and landscapes despite its inhospitable conditions, the surface of venus has been studied extensively through telescopes and probes. scientists have discovered a vast array of landscapes, ranging from mountains, volcanoes, and plains to canyons and craters. some of the most prominent features include aphrodite terra, the largest highland region on the planet, and maxwell montes, a mountain range that stands over 11 kilometers nearly 7 miles tall. these geological features provide valuable insight into venus' geological history, helping us understand its formation and evolution. exploration of venus several missions have been launched to study venus, including nasa's magellan orbiter, which mapped over 98 of the planet's surface between 1990 and 1994. the european space agency's venus express mission, which operated from 2006 to 2014, provided valuable data on venus' atmospheric composition and cloud dynamics. in the future, nasa's veritas venus emissivity, radio science, insar, topography, and spectroscopy mission is planned to study venus using a radar instrument, aiming to create the first global topographic map of the planet. while venus may seem like an inhospitable, lifeless world, it continues to captivate researchers and space enthusiasts alike. its unique characteristics, such as its thick atmosphere and extreme temperatures, make it a valuable subject for scientific study. as we continue to explore our solar system, venus serves as a fascinating reminder of how diverse and complex our universe can be.",0,0,0.022957562418426652

"this article is about the patent of venus that are sometimes called evening star this is the second planet from our sun, this planet is one that the people can see from a large distance it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. this is the most dangerous for the people because the sun is like the fire the people can't see and touch this in a short distance the sun, and they light can be beautiful but is it most thing that is dangerous in the universe. venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too, venus is a planet visit for the people, venus have many things that are interesting the people visit this place for know something's that they don't know, but they need to know venus is one planet that are close with mart and earth venus is study for the human science. a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon blankets venus. on the planet the temperatures average can be over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is like 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet, the conditions of the planet can be more extreme than anything humans encounter on the planet earth venus is the only planet that have the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, the other planet that are closer to the sun is mercury, beyond high pressure and heat. venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting of volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to a lang on its surface. venus have numerous factors that contribute reputation as a challenging patent for humans to study, despite its proximity to us, venus should have a sulfuric acid in the venus atmosphere in all of this we have a question why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface.? venus is a fascinated planet for the astronomers because it may well once have been the most earth like planet in the solar system venus is a planet know for the rocks and gas that there is.",1,1,0.9999984867972248
"modern technology undoubtedly makes life more convenient. from the internet that enables us to access an endless sea of knowledge to advanced machinery that can automate complex tasks, technology has made life easier in a myriad of ways. take, for example, the transportation revolution that has taken place in the past few decades. cars, buses, and trains have drastically improved, making it'simpler than ever to get from point a to point b. many cities now have ride sharing systems like uber and lyft that make taking a taxi much more convenient. in addition, airplanes and other forms of air travel have made it possible to cross vast distances in just a matter of hours. technology has also revolutionized communication. smartphones, computers, and other digital devices now enable us to talk to people from all over the world, no matter how far apart we are. video conferencing, instant messaging, and social media platforms have made it easier than ever to stay in touch with distant friends and family. in short, modern technology has made a variety of everyday tasks much simpler. from ordering groceries online to finding the best route to a destination, the internet and other forms of technology have made our lives immeasurably easier. that said, some may argue that life was better when technology was simpler. there is certainly something to be said for the simpler, slower paced life of the past. without the constant barrage of notifications and alerts, people had more time to relax and enjoy life. in the end, it all comes down to personal preference. perhaps life was better when technology was simpler, but there is no denying that modern technology has made our lives much more convenient. we can now access an endless sea of knowledge, communicate with people from all over the world, and automate complex tasks with just a few clicks of a button. for these reasons, i believe that modern technology has made life more convenient.",0,0,0.001554959972264488
"the use of electronic dictionaries e dictionaries has become increasingly popular among students. although these devices can provide quick and accurate translations, some teachers are concerned that the overuse of e dictionaries may have more disadvantages than advantages when it comes to english learning. i believe that the use of e dictionaries should be limited and that there are more disadvantages than advantages when it comes to english learning. one of the primary disadvantages of overusing e dictionaries is that it can lead to a deterioration of spelling ability. as students rely on the e dictionaries to provide the correct spelling, they are not required to remember or practice spelling words correctly. this can lead to a lack of understanding of the english language and can have a negative effect on written work. for example, if a student relies heavily on an e dictionary to spell words, they may not be able to spell the same words correctly when they are not using the device. another disadvantage of overusing e dictionaries is that it can lead to a lack of understanding of the english language. while e dictionaries can provide accurate translations, they cannot provide a full understanding of the language. this is because e dictionaries only provide literal translations, whereas a full understanding of a language requires a deeper understanding of the context and usage of words. for example, if a student only uses an e dictionary to translate a word, they may not understand the nuances of the language, such as the difference between the words affect and effect . finally, the overuse of e dictionaries can lead to a lack of creativity and originality in written work. as students rely on the e dictionaries to provide the correct spelling and translation, they are less likely to think of creative alternatives to express their ideas. this can lead to a lack of originality in written work, as students are not required to think of creative ways to express their ideas. in conclusion, while e dictionaries can be useful tools for students, the overuse of these devices can lead to a number of disadvantages when it comes to english learning. therefore, i believe that the use of e dictionaries should be limited and that there are more disadvantages than advantages when it comes to english learning.",0,0,6.619139110985636e-06
"social media has become a big part of our lives, and with it, we share a lot of personal information online. from what we eat to where we go, everything is out there for the world to see. but with this increase in sharing, there has also been an increase in privacy concerns. some people believe that we need stronger privacy protections on social media, while others think it's not necessary. in my opinion, i believe that we do need stronger privacy protections on social media. firstly, sharing personal information online can be dangerous. hackers and other cybercriminals can use this information to steal our identities or even harm us physically. for example, if someone posts their location on social media, a criminal could use that information to find and attack them. this is why it's important to have stronger privacy protections in place to keep our personal information safe. secondly, social media companies often use our personal information for their own benefit. they collect data on our likes, dislikes, and online behavior to target us with ads. this may seem harmless, but it's actually an invasion of our privacy. we should have the right to control how our personal information is used and who has access to it. lastly, privacy is a fundamental human right. we should be able to share what we want with whom we want without fear of our information being used against us. stronger privacy protections on social media would give us the peace of mind that our personal information is safe and secure. in conclusion, i strongly believe that we need stronger privacy protections on social media. it's important to keep our personal information safe from hackers and cybercriminals, and we should have the right to control how our data is used. privacy is a fundamental human right, and we should do everything we can to protect it.",0,0,1.3534442367684546e-05
