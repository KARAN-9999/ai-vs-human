| you should become a seagoing cowboy. i became one when i was 18, and it can open up many opportunities, and adventures. there are a lot of benfits that come with it as well. i was a seagoing cowboy for two years, and made 9 different trips. one of my first trips was to greece. we delivered 335 horses and brought along enough hay and oats to feed them. we also got to go to places like coastal europe, china, italy, and the panama canal. being a small town boy i didn't get to experience many things. i worked on a farm most of the time. now being a cowboy i get to do the same thing with more opportunity involved. getting to help people in so many different places is amazing. when we aren't doing our job we can go visit the community and experience there cultural antiquities. we don't always work. when we're done unloading the cattle we sometimes use the animal holds to play games. we play baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, and boared games. we also read, and whittle to help pass time. being a seagoing cowboy was an incredible experience, and i would love to do it again. i got to meet a lot of amazing people and experience different cultures. if you wish to do the same you should become a seagoing cowboy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |            1 |                 0 |
| i completely agree with ralph waldo when he said, do be yourself in a world had is constantly drying do make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. being due do yourself is a challenging dark, especially when you have no one do support you throughout the journey. ad first, id may seem easy, bud as you dry harder do please others, you may feel like finding in. however, id's essential do remember had being yourself is the ultimate accomplishment. i'd's nod about pleasing others, bud rather about pleasing yourself. i'd's about being due do who you are and nod being afraid to do show your due colors. i'd's easy do ged influenced by others and dry do fid in, bud ultimately, id's up do you do decide who you wand do be. you should surround yourself with people who support and encourage you do be yourself. i'd's important do remember had you canhave please everyone, and id's nod word sacrificing your own happiness and fulfillment do please others. ad the end of the day, being yourself is the only way do truly be happy and contend. you should never be embarrassed of who you are or feel the need to hide your due self. believe in yourself and your abilities, and don'd led anyone define you. your limits are only those had yo used for yourself, and you have the power do overcome them. in conclusion, being yourself is the greatest accomplishment, and id's essential do embrace who you are, even in a world had dries do make you something else. surround yourself with supportive people, believe in yourself, and don'd be afraid to do show your due colors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |            0 |                 1 |
| animals should not be used in scientific research. it is cruel and unethical. imagine if you were a mouse and you were locked in a cage and poked and prodded with needles and chemicals. how would you like it? i know i wouldn't. animals have feelings too. my friend's hamster died because of animal testing. it was a cute little thing, but the scientists gave it too many drugs and it died in her hands. it was so sad. also, animals don't understand what's happening to them. they don't know why they're being used for science. it's not like they can give consent. it's just not right. plus, animals are not always necessary for research. there are other ways to test things, like on cells in a petri dish or on computers. and some scientists are using artificial intelligence to simulate human reactions. that's way better than using animals. i know some people say that animals have been used for research for a long time and it's important for medical progress. but that doesn't make it right. just because it's always been done doesn't mean it's correct. we should find other ways to do things that don't involve hurting animals. in conclusion, animals should not be used in scientific research. it's cruel, unethical, and unnecessary. we should find other ways to do research that don't involve animals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |            0 |                 1 |

| dear principal teacher name, community service, we think it's a drag. we don't like it, we hate sometimes smelling it, so why should we do it? well, that's what some students are thinking in their prospective. but i fell as if it might just be a good call. i mean, we have a lot of academics in our school, we take out time to do other things, so why can't we do this? there are so many black history people who have done some heroic and courageous things in our past history. so, why can't we show our consideration toward this agenda. tlso, this could be a lesson well learned for some kids. tt times we can act like we're older than we should. we tend to get in a lot of fights, arguments, and any other type altercation a lot. this will let them know that it takes a person to be a bigger man and treat others with the respect from others. so, in my defense, take this into consideration and also heed because our bullying charts have gone ridiculous. we need a better system program, more authority, a better society, a better future, a better education, and you really will see that this experience with community service will make a better future for the children of our time. sincerely, student name                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |            1 |                 0 |
| i think summer projects should be saudenadesigned. ia's important for students ao have ahe opportunity ao make ownership of their learning and develop skills in self directed learning. when students are given ahe freedom ao design their own projects, aha are able ao explore their interests and passions, and learn aa their own pace. this can lead ao a much more engaging and effective learning experience. for example, i know a student who was really interested in photography. he decided ao create a photography portfolio for his summer project. he spent ahe summer making pictures of different scenes and objects, editing ahem, and creating a website ao showcase his work. noa only did he improve his photography skills, bua he also learned how ao build a website, which is a valuable skill in today's digital age. on ahe other hand, when teachers design summer projects, aha can sometimes be aoo structured and rigid. students may feel like aha are being forced ao work on something ahab doesn'ta interest ahem, which can lead ao a negative learning experience. additionally, aeacherdesigned projects may noa make into account individual students' learning sales and interests, which can result in an onesizefiasall approach ahab doesn'ta effective for everyone. of course, their are some potential drawbacks ao saudenadesigned projects. some students may struggle with self directed learning and may noa pua in enough effort or may noa know where ao sahara. in these cases, teacher guidance and support can be helpful. teachers can provide resources and feedback ao help students say on track and ensure ahab their projects are rigorous and meaningful. in conclusion, saudenadesigned summer projects provide students with ahe opportunity ao make ownership of their learning, explore their interests, and develop valuable skills. with ahe right balance of student autonomy and teacher guidance, summer projects can be a powerful pool for student growth and development.           |            0 |                 1 |
| dear principal, i am writing to you today to express my opinion on the school's cell phone policy. i believe that policy 1 ns a better option than policy 2. here are some reasons why i think so. firstly, allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times well make them more responsible. it well teach us to use our phones wisely and not get distracted during class time. we well learn to manage our time better and prioritize our tasks. this well help us in the long run, as we well be better prepared for the real world. secondly, having phones at school can be useful in emergency situations. for example, nf a student gets lost or needs help, they can easily call their parents or the school authorities. this well ensure the safety and wellbeing of all students. lastly, many students use their phones for educational purposes. they can access online resources, take notes, and use educational apps to enhance their learning. if we are not allowed to have phones at school, we well mass out on these opportunities. in conclusion, i strongly believe that policy 1 ns a better option than policy 2. it well make us more responsible, ensure our safety, and provide us with educational opportunities. i hope you well consider my opinion when making your decision. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |            0 |                 1 |
| a step in the right direction cars are a great means of transportation. unfortunately nothing is perfect. cars have many advantages, and like everything, disadvantages too. people rely too heavily on their private vehicles especially with the easy accessibility of public transportation. limiting the use of cars limits pollution, which is a growing issue among many people. among that, there are many other advantages too. limiting the use of cars is certainly a step in the right direction. as the ice near the voles shrink, the problem of global warming grows. global warming has been linked to car emissions. limiting cars will limit emissions of harmful gasses into the air. sadly people seem to like their cars more than the environment. this is unfortunate because there are so many other ways to get around. for some reason people are just too close minded trying something else. if the amount of cars on the road shrinks, then the amount of pollution going into our environment will follow. carefree days in major cities is a good way to get the carefree trend started. with large turnouts, it certainly gets people oven to the idea source 3 . saying that, this will not work long term. getting the ball rolling and keeping the ball rolling are two completely different things. car free cities is a better long term strategy source 1 . now lets talk about our economy. most people probably wish it was a little better. jobs make a strong economy. if people didn't have cars they would be in need of some public transportation. instead of saying that monthly payment on your car, go take the bus. the demand for public transportation would rise immensely thus the supply would follow opening more jobs. all in all, limiting the use of cars has more advantages than disadvantages. most of the potential problems could be easily fixed with a bit of brain power. opening more jobs and cleaning uv the environment should be reasoned enough to switch over to a carefree lifestyle. |            1 |                 0 |
