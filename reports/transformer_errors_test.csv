"mr. principal, i would like to let you know how i, and many others feel about volunteering and community service. i believe it should not be required but should be kept as a free choice. furthermore, i feel volunteer work as a required task would give it less value because of the reason behind the good work. furthermore, i believe community service does benefit the community and many people in different ways. some people need their time for school work and for their own daily lives and volunteer work may disrupt their schedules and routines. some people have a hard time with other activities, and volunteering for other service activities limits time for their own commitments. i believe the best solution to let students experience community service, is to always have the options open. also, the school can bring volunteering and community service into its student programs such as with fundraisers. this way, i believe students can receive a combination of a good school, life, and service experience.",1,0
"dear principal, i think the new school policy is a great idea. playing sports and participating in other activities is a privilege. so if students can't maintain a b average then i think they don't deserve to play sports or do other activities. i like this policy because there are many students who are struggling with their grades that like to play sports or do other activities. so this will encourage them to boost their grades up. if students are struggling academically then this will give them another reason to try and keep their grades up. even though they may not realize it, this will be helping them in another way, it will also help their gpa and make them more qualified for better schools rather than students with c averages. so if these students really have a desire for sports then they will try their hardest to keep their grades up. frankly, i think this would work because i know there are a lot of students that love sports and other activities, so they will keep striving for that b average. yours truly, student jame",1,0

"phones while driving safe behavior? as technology development grows at an exponential rate and far more places have access to internet and phones, many people have begun to experience the benefits of globalization, meanwhile however, accidents on highways and freeways are on the rise as a direct result of people using their phones while operating motored vehicles, not only putting themselves in danger but others as well. this is an unsafe behavior that deserves great attention and society needs to come together to come up with a plan to prevent future accidents. it is true that everyday more and more businesses conduct their activities online and most jobs require employees to be on their phones for a large amount of time, prospecting and client outreach may come at an unexpected time, and some may argue that the act of being the phone while driving is often times necessary to conduct business, this however comes at a great cost, and the risks associated with this behavior could be fatal according to experts at a local university in kansas. 9 people are killed and more than 1,000 are injured daily in incidents reported as distraction affected crashes in the united states fcc , and in 2013 it was reported that, according to a national survey in the us, the number of drivers who reported using their cellphones to access the internet while driving had risen to nearly one of four. usa today the bottom line is that phones and motored vehicles do not mix well and the action of using a cellular device while driving must be avoided. as more data continues to emerge, the numbers of laws and regulations in response to this issue are also growing, consequently making the roads safer for everyone.",1,0
i think that distance learning is a good idea for students. some students might not be able to go to skool because they are sick or they live far away. with distance learning they can still lern and particapate in class. they can watch the teacher on the computer and do the work on there own. they can even ask questions and get help from the teacher. sometime students might not understand something and they can rewind the video and watch it agen. this way they can make shure they understand it befor they move on to the next lesson. they can even pause the video and take notes. another good thing about distance learning is that students can work at there own pace. if they need more time to understand somethig they can take it. if they are fast learner they can go ahed and finish the work early. some students might not like being in a classroom with lots of other students. they might feel nervus or shy. with distance learning they can learn in there own space and feel more comfortable. i think that distance learning is a good option for students. it allows them to learn from home and have more control over there learning. it also helps students who cant come to skool for some reason. please grade this essay and provide feedback. thank you.,0,1

"only about 40 of students participate in after school activities. schools tend to offer a wide variety of activities such as drama, lacrosse, debate, band, and so much more. despite all of the activities, some student's don't feel the need to join any clubs or teams. therefore, making students participate in at least one extracurricular activity wouldn't be a good idea because students may not have enough time, not enjoy any of the activities, or feel mad. even though students are young, they can be pretty busy. many students participate in activities outside of school, which can cause their schedule to be pretty tight, and that's not even counting homework. some may barely have enough time to transition between school and any other activity they may have. so if someone made it mandatory for students to join a club or team, they would have to drop another activity, which they might feel really passionate about. schools tend to offer many activities, but they don't offer all of them. as a result, there will be students who just aren't interested in any of them. many may feel it's best not to waste their time on something they won't enjoy. so making students participate in an activity may cause them to not feel motivated in whatever they're doing, which can bring the whole team or group down. if a student is forced into an activity they don't enjoy, they wont want to do much with the group team. if schools force students to join a team or club, they might feel like their free will has been stripped away from them. many students today can get upset really quickly. students may want to rebel and skip the meetings practices. they may even get angry and try to shut the whole idea down, or rant on social media. forcing students to do extracurricular activities can cause them to get even more homework, which can really effect their mental health, depending on the situation. overall, forcing students to do extracurricular actives is a bad idea because they wont have enough time, may not want to do any of the activities, or even get angry. schools should stay the way they are, and only offer the activities and not force them. even if it may seem like a good idea to make extracurriculars mandatory at first, it wont take long for it to backfire.",1,0

"dear state senator, i think we should change the election system to where the president is elected by popular vote. the electoral college system just dosn t seem fair. i know some people argue that the electoral college system is good because it makes sure that presidential canidates visit different parts of the country. but, that dosn t realy matter if the canidate dosn t win the popular vote. it just dosn t seem right that a person can get more votes then the other person and still not win. also, the electoral college system can lead to a situation where a president is elected even if they don t have the most votes. this happend in the 2000 election when george w. bush became president even though al gore got more votes. this dosn t seem fair and it makes me wonder if the system is broken. furthermore, the electoral college system can also lead to a situation where a third party canidate can t win even if they have a lot of support. this is because the system is set up so that the canidate with the most votes in a state gets all of that states electoral votes. this means that a third party canidate would have to have a lot of support in a lot of different states to have a chance at winning. i think we should change the system to where the president is elected by popular vote. this way, the person with the most votes will win and it will be a more fair system. we should do this because it is important that our president is elected in a fair and democratic way. thank you for listening to my opion. sincerely, your name",0,1
"drivers should not use cell phones in any capacity while driving in today's society, cell phones have become an integral part of everyday life for most people. however, operating a vehicle requires a driver's full attention and using a cell phone can seriously distract from safely controlling the car. for this reason, drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any way when driving. there are several dangers of using a phone while driving. talking or texting on the phone takes the driver's eyes off the road for prolonged periods. this means they are not fully aware of their surroundings and what is happening with other vehicles. even hands free calling requires focusing mental attention on the conversation instead of on driving. distracted driving in this way has been shown to reduce reaction times as much as having a blood alcohol concentration over the legal driving limit. cell phone use also increases the likelihood of accidents. statistics show that drivers who use phones are four times more likely to be involved in a crash serious enough to injure themselves or others. as vehicles travel at high speeds, even brief distractions can have dangerous consequences if something unexpected happens on the road. requiring both hands and eyes on the wheel is necessary for full control of the car. some argue that they can multitask and drive safely while using a phone. however, the risks of distractions are simply too high compared to alternatives like listening to voicemails later or assigning calls to go to voicemail until reaching a destination. the safest approach is a total hands off policy for any phone functions besides emergency use. overall road safety should take priority over non emergency phone conversations or messages. in conclusion, allowing any type of cell phone use while driving compromises road safety and puts all motorists at risk. a complete ban is justified given the clear dangers and statistics concerning phone related crashes. for the welfare of everyone on the road, drivers should keep both hands on the wheel and eyes on the road instead of a phone screen or call. cell phones should not be used in any way when operating a vehicle.",0,1

"dear principal, i think that community service is a marvelous idea. it would help our community be a much better place to live and learn. there would be less liter, which would make it a much cleaner environment. tutoring is very important and can help children strive in school. however, not everyone has the time to do all these things. making it mandatory to do community service would serve as a punishment and would take time away from things students like or need to do. huch as sports, which help students learn valuable skills like teamwork, responsibility, and discipline. plus, the more a child practices at these sports, the more chance they have on getting a scholarship for them to go to college. i understand that maybe we need more people doing community service, but not everyone has the time to do it. i think letting community service be voluntary is a better idea. hincerely, student name",1,0
i think we should ban single use plastics. they are bad for the earth and us. they pollute our oceans and water ways. animals eat them and get sick or die. we cant reuse them so we just throw them away. that means they go to the dump or in the wild. we cant just keep using plastic bottles and straws and bags when we can use other things like metal and paper and cloth. plastic takes a long time to break down and it never really goes away. it just breaks into smaller and smaller pieces that animals can eat or we can breathe in. we are already seeing the effects of plastic pollution. there are huge islands of plastic in the ocean. fish are dying from eating plastic. we are eating fish that have eaten plastic. its not good for us. we need to use things that we can reuse and recycle. we should use metal or glass bottles instead of plastic. we can use paper straws or straws made from plants. we can use cloth bags instead of plastic bags. we can also just carry things ourselves instead of using bags. banning single use plastics might be hard but it's important. we have to do it to save the earth and ourselves. other places have banned plastic bags and straws and it has helped a lot. we can do it too. we can start by banning plastic bags and straws and then move on to other things like bottles and cups. people might say that its hard to change but we have to try. we have to do it for the earth and our future. we can't just keep using plastic and pretend there is no problem. we have to take action. we can do it! i hope you agree with me that we should ban single use plastics. let's make a change and help the earth and ourselves.,0,1
