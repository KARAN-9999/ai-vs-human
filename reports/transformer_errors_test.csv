"the use of technology has revolutionized the way we stay in contact with people. nowadays, it is easier than ever before for friends, family, and colleagues to connect with one another from any distance. with the aid of technology, businesses and schools can communicate with customers and students quickly and efficiently. however, the convenience of technology has also had its downside. people may become used to being in constant contact, and thus may not develop important social skills that can only be acquired through face to face interactions. also, as technology is constantly changing, some may struggle to keep up with the newest advancements. overall, technology has had both positive and negative effects on how people interact with one another. on one hand, it has allowed us to connect with people more quickly and efficiently than ever before. on the other hand, it may also be detrimental if overused or not used with the proper care. as technology continues to be a major part of our lives, it is important to remember the value of traditional methods of communication as well.",0,0,4.048133799470657e-05
"with the higher speed development of the whole global village, people are becoming much more eager to enlarge their spiritual world. i agree with you that the world is becoming more and more interconnected, but i don't think that this is necessarily a bad thing. in fact, i think it is a good thing, because it means that we are all connected to each other in a much deeper way than we have been in the past. but i also believe that there are some things that should be left to the private sector. for example, if you want to build a theater or a sports stadium, you have to pay for it out of your own pocket. you can't borrow money from the bank and then spend it on something else. if you are going to spend a lot of money, then you need to make sure that you can pay back the money you borrow. that is why i am against the idea of public private partnerships ppps in this area. the government should not be in charge of financing these kinds of projects. it is better to let the market take care of it, and that is exactly what is happening in many other areas of life, such as education, health care, transportation, housing, etc. there is no reason why the same thing cannot be done for the arts and culture as well.",0,0,0.09557604783676077
"the casual coding system enabling identification of human emotions. i agree with an idea that it's valuable to use the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. a classroom computer would recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. this means that when a student is not feeling well at all the classroom computer would let the teacher know and the teacher san find solutions to the student. this san help both a teacher and a student because the teacher sank now when the student s is ready to learn and san contribute to the academic performance. then it would modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. this means that the classroom computer is something very important became students san understand the lesson which is beneficial. the classroom computer would also read when students are stressed no consecrating. the classroom computer san let the teacher help student get out of stressors. this is the most important to students because san contribute to the future of student by identifying whoever needs help. prolonged sadness for some students. the classroom computer san help student in many ways, some student san't identify their feelings or emotions. depression is something that san harm people mentally and some students including me don't we don't want other people teacher know what's going on in ours life. so the classroom computer san identify us and notify the teacher which san help us get help. therefore, the classroom computer is something to consider in schools or classrooms. it's helpful to both teacher and a student.",1,1,0.9999624547728632
"in today's highly competitive job market, obtaining a degree certificate has become increasingly important. however, there is growing concern that focusing solely on academic achievements can lead to a narrow view of success. while a degree certificate may open the door to certain opportunities, it does not necessarily reflect one's overall abilities and skillet. in this essay, i will argue that while degree certificates are important, they should not be the sole measure of success. firstly, a degree certificate only reflects a person's academic achievements, which may not be indicative of their overall abilities. for instance, a person who has a degree in mathematics may be highly intelligent in that subject but may lack other essential skills such as communication, teamwork, or leadership. in contrast, a person who has not obtained a degree but has gained real world experience may have a broader range of skills and knowledge that are highly valued by employers. therefore, it is unfair to judge a person solely based on their academic achievements. secondly, the job market is constantly evolving, and the skills required for success are continually changing. a degree certificate may be essential in some fields, but it may not be relevant in others. moreover, some skills such as creativity, problem solving, and adaptability cannot be taught in a classroom but are essential for success in today's job market. therefore, it is important to recognize that a degree certificate is not the only measure of success and should not be the primary factor when making hiring decisions. lastly, it is essential to promote diversity in the workplace. focusing solely on degree certificates may limit diversity as it may exclude talented individuals who have not had the opportunity to obtain a degree. in contrast, considering a person's overall abilities and skills can lead to a more diverse and inclusive workforce. in conclusion, while degree certificates are important, they should not be the sole measure of success. it is essential to consider a person's overall abilities and skills when making hiring decisions. additionally, it is important to recognize that the job market is constantly changing, and the skills required for success are continually evolving. therefore, focusing solely on academic achievements may limit diversity and exclude talented individuals.",0,0,2.857676447680596e-07
"i think that if a student has a b average that they shouldn't be able to participate in sports because to some students, sports and school are just too much for them. when students are trying to have good grades in school and be in sports at the same time, it gets too hard for them and their grades drop lower. if a student that want to play sports but has bad grades, they should work hard to get into the sports that they want to be in. they shouldn't just barely pass and be able to be in sports. some kids work hard to get into sports, and when someone that just barely passed gets into sports, it makes the other kids mad because they worked so hard to get where they were. some kids think it's unfair that they couldn't get into sports because of their grades. they have to improve their grades to get what they want. and if they don't want to, then they shouldn't be allowed in sports. so i think that students should work hard for what they want. i think it's only fair that students with an a average should have a choice to be in sports or not.",1,1,0.9104240235382424

"focus on the road do you thing you should be on your device while driving a vehicle? it's very dangerous and most people don't even thing about it. most people get distracted because of social media or to even text a friend. electronic devices today are a big distraction in today's world causing lack of communication, lack of exercising and a lot of problems. teenagers have the most accidents while driving because they're either on the phone or talking to someone. you should use the phone when you arrive at your destination. until then focus on the road. while being on the road you should be able to focus on your location and other cars around you. you shouldn't let anything distract you from taking your eyes off the road. traffic goes on a lot, and you shouldn't worry about picking up a phone. texting on the phone while driving can cause you to react more slowly than you expect. some people may thing there are professionals at multitasking, but it's wrong. try to avoid distractions so you can be safe. it is bad to use your phone while driving because it is dangerous. in addition to voice calling, activities such as texting while driving, web browsing, playing videos, or phone use in general can also increase the rise of a crash. crashes are increasing every year because of distracted driving. distracted driving is one of the biggest and most common reasons. it's caused by any activity that takes your attention off the road. the only time you should use your phone is when you need help going somewhere. if you need help getting around you can use your gps on your phone. before you get in the car you should set up your gps and put it in a spot you can keep glazing at. you should also use a bluetooth device to help you communicate. also, if something happens to your pull over and call someone. drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. it's best to stay safe at all times while driving. focus on the road until you reach your destination and always avoid distractions. without cell phone distractions the rate of car crashes will decrease. so do you thing you should be on your device while driving?",1,1,0.9983352455563745
"everyone faces challenges in their lives, and it's common to feel overwhelmed by them. however, i believe that problems are not as daunting as they may seem. as the famous musician duke ellington once said, a problem is a chance for you to do your best. i agree with this statement for several reasons. firstly, problems motivate us to work harder. many successful business people have faced numerous challenges, but they persevered and overcame them. for example, the movie the social network portrays mark zuckerberg and his team facing numerous obstacles while building facebook. despite the setbacks, they continued to work hard and eventually succeeded in creating one of the most successful social media platforms in history. problems push us to push harder and achieve our goals. secondly, problems help us set our goals. when we face challenges, we often feel compelled to find a solution and achieve a specific outcome. for instance, when i was a child, i had a problem with my vision that made it difficult for me to read. this problem motivated me to seek help and eventually led me to get glasses, which improved my vision and helped me excel in school. problems can be the catalysts that drive us to achieve our goals and create a better life for ourselves. lastly, problems help us learn from our mistakes. when we encounter problems, we are often forced to reflect on what went wrong and how we can improve in the future. for example, when i started my first business, i made several mistakes that led to its failure. however, i learned from those mistakes and applied them to my next business venture. this experience taught me the importance of learning from my mistakes and using them to grow and succeed. in conclusion, problems are not inherently bad. they can motivate us to work harder, help us set our goals, and teach us valuable lessons about ourselves and the world around us. as duke ellington said, a problem is a chance for you to do your best. by embracing problems and learning from them, we can become better versions of ourselves and make a positive impact on the world.",0,0,8.158641025610443e-05
"phones and driving distracted drivers kill one in ten people every day in the united states and injure 1500. texting is one of the main distractions that cause these drives to kill and injure people. while texting you aren't focused on things that matter like the road and that causes these types of accidents to happen. people don't realize how serious this is, the driver might lose control of the car and their reaction time won't be fast enough. in 2011, accidents involving a distracted driver killed 3,331 people. habits like texting and driving are important to break. an example of a simple solution to this problem is to simply turn off your phone, it will block out buzzers or vibrations that will tempt anyone to check their phone. many states in the united states have already passed the no texting and driving law. people still believe that texting and driving is no big deal and have confidence they can text and drive simultaneously. however. lots of teens spend 15 of their time not in their lane. with the advanced technology we have today, we should be using voice activated responses and apps to tell people when someone is driving, and they'll get to them shortly. preventing texting and driving can be a simple problem to overcome but very difficult. but if everyone works hard to make it happen we could be saving many lives every day. wf the situation is so important to put someone else's life in danger then why drive at all? because in reality one text or call could wreck it all.",1,1,0.9864910523232497

"title the mystery of the face on mars the red planet, mars, has captured the imagination of humans for centuries due to its mysterious features and potential for life. among these features is the infamous face on mars, a geological formation that has sparked numerous debates, theories, and even conspiracies. this essay aims to explore the face on mars, its discovery, and the various hypotheses that attempt to explain its existence. the face on mars was discovered in 1976 by the american photographer, vincent dipietro, and nasa scientist, gregory molenaar, while examining images taken by the viking 1 orbiter spacecraft during its mission to mars. the images showed an unusual rock formation that resembled a human face, prompting speculation about its origin and purpose. since its discovery, various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the face on mars. the most prominent theory suggests that the formation is a result of natural erosion and weathering processes on the martian surface. proponents of this theory argue that the face is a result of wind, water, and other geological phenomena that shaped the landscape over millions of years. another popular hypothesis is that the face is an artificial creation, possibly left by an ancient civilization on mars. proponents of the artificial origin theory argue that the symmetrical features and apparent eye sockets suggest the face was intentionally crafted. however, no definitive proof has been provided to support this claim. a third theory suggests that the face on mars is a result of natural geological processes, but it has been influenced by extraterrestrial intelligence. this hypothesis posits that an intelligent species may have intentionally altered or enhanced the natural formation to create a human like image. despite the various explanations, the true identity and origin of the face on mars remains a mystery. further studies and exploration are needed to uncover the secrets of this fascinating geological formation. in conclusion, the face on mars continues to intrigue scientists and space enthusiasts alike. while numerous theories attempt to explain its existence, no definitive answer has been found. as we continue to explore mars, perhaps we will uncover more evidence that helps solve the mystery of the face on mars.",0,0,0.0015148208883279106
"starting a homework club at a middle school could be beneficial for students by helping them stay on top of assignments and build organizational and study skills. with all members of the club in the same age group, students could feel more comfortable collaborating and discussing problems together. time could be a challenge, as students often have a variety of activities they are involved in already, and further commitments may be difficult to take on. although the club would mostly be self directed, adult supervision or guidance would be necessary to keep members focused and on task. motivation may fluctuate, so it would be important to come up with ways to keep the members engaged and committed to participating in the club. working as a group could also inspire students to be kinder and more supportive of one another, teaching the importance of collaboration and camaraderie. finally, volunteer work could be encouraged for members who put in extra effort or help the members who may be struggling. with the right approach, a homework club could be a great way for students to learn important skills and stay focused on schoolwork.",0,0,0.000542632739286655
"the face is a natural martian mesa, like many others. people have wondered if aliens have built it before, but they had no proof. nasa has already proven with evidence it is just a natural land formation. first, nasa decided to release the pictures of the face for the public to see, but they only did this to get more people intrested in mars! to prove that the face was just a land formation naturaly made, nasa decided to show better quality photos to the public. so they sent out pictures that were ten times sharper to show it was a rock formation. also if there was life on mars nasa would benifit from it, so i dont see why they would lie. next, mars is a planet with many unknown discoverys but the ones that nasa do figure out the more information we gain for the future. for example in the text it says that mars has many martian mesas, so it could be a coinicidence that one looks like a face. this doesn't prove there isn't life on mars but for the information we have at the moment it is doubtful. lastly, there are many people in the would who make this stuff up, so why would believe their opinion over nasa who research on space. don't forget that the only reason they got the information of the face was because nasa unvieled it. if they had something they didn't want us to know about they would have kept it to themselves. the face is just a rock formation. others might say something like it looks like a human face, or why would it look like a face if the life on mars hadn't built it. the reason it looks like a face is because the mesa formed that way. it couldn't even have been built by life on mars because it's over 2 miles wide, so it has to be a land formation.",1,1,0.9990495393835239
"the psychological effects of bereavement are profound, and can be long lasting. for those who have lost a loved one to death, the grief process is difficult and often unpredictable. this essay will explore how individuals grapple with the loss of a family member or close friend, focusing on both the physical and emotional effects that accompany mourning. when experiencing any kind of loss, it is common for people to feel disoriented and confused as they attempt to come to terms with their new reality. shock is also very common at first feelings of numbness may prevent an individual from fully comprehending what has happened until much later on in the grieving process. during this time, there may also be intense feelings of sadness and anger which can manifest physically in forms like headaches or body aches these symptoms are thought to arise due to increased levels of stress hormones such as cortisol which cause tension throughout our bodies when we experience sudden changes or trauma. while some physical distress comes with bereavement, many people s primary reaction is an emotional one an extreme sense of loneliness or even despair over having lost someone so important in their life. the emotions associated with grief can range from guilt for not being able to 'save' them all the way through disbelief at no longer having them by your side this rollercoaster ride only intensifies during moments where memories related to the deceased flood back into consciousness such as visiting places you used spend time together . in addition, certain tasks that were once performed by them must now be undertaken by other members within your social circle this shift might bring up additional feelings of emptiness if these responsibilities had been shared between both parties for quite some time prior. . death leaves behind a huge void which cannot easily be filled understanding this truth allows us acknowledge its permanence while simultaneously giving ourselves permission move forward without feeling guilty over doing so eventually transitioning away from mourning towards more positive headspace where bittersweet fondness lies instead .",0,0,0.00014048942193550947

"title exploring venus venus, also known as the sister planet to earth, has long captured the imagination of astronomers and scientists. it is the second planet from the sun and is often referred to as earth's twin due to their similar sizes and mass. however, venus is not a hospitable place for humans, and exploring its surface is a challenging and complex task. one major reason venus is not a suitable place for human exploration is its incredibly hot and dense atmosphere, which is composed mainly of carbon dioxide. the atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is around 90 times that of earth, making it impossible for humans or any current spacecraft to land safely. to study venus, scientists rely on unmanned spacecraft, which have been designed to withstand extreme conditions. one of the most significant missions to explore venus was the soviet union's venera program. the venera 7 mission, which landed on venus in 1970, was the first spacecraft to successfully land on a planet other than earth. this mission provided crucial information about venus's atmosphere, surface, and climate. in recent years, nasa's magellan mission, launched in 1989, used radar to map the planet's surface, providing a detailed look at its geography. the european space agency's venus express mission, launched in 2005, studied the planet's atmosphere, clouds, and ionosphere. these missions have helped scientists understand the unique features of venus and its evolution. despite significant advancements in technology and scientific understanding, exploring the planet's surface remains elusive. one proposed solution is to build an airplane like vehicle capable of flying through venus's atmosphere. however, the extreme conditions and the challenges associated with creating an aerodynamic vehicle in such conditions make this approach extremely difficult. another idea is to develop an airship, similar to the one used in earth's atmosphere. this airship would be able to float and maneuver around the dense venusian atmosphere. however, designing an airship that can withstand the harsh conditions of venus would be a significant engineering challenge. in conclusion, while exploration of venus has come a long way, with the help of unmanned spacecraft and innovative ideas, the planet's surface remains largely unexplored. future missions and technological advancements may one day lead to human exploration of venus, but for now, it remains a mysterious and intriguing world to study from afar.",0,0,0.005162058941370863

"recycling is one of the most important environmental initiatives we can take up in our daily lives. as global citizens, it's essential that we become conscious and more responsible when it comes to reusing materials and reducing waste. the benefits of recycling are highly beneficial both economically and environmentally as well as personal health wise. economically, recycling conserves resources by reducing the need for raw materials to make new products fewer natural resources have to be used each time a recycled material is reused in manufacturing processes or consumer goods. this has obvious financial implications, as using less raw material means lower production costs which results in cost savings for businesses throughout the supply chain from manufacturers through distributors, retailers and ultimately consumers too! in addition, there are often government incentives available for companies who demonstrate good efforts on sustainability practices like recycling. environmentally speaking, recycling helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions due to decreased energy consumption since making items with existing materials uses much less energy than creating them from scratch does this goes double for hazardous materials such as tires or batteries where special disposal methods must be used if not properly recycled! additionally, landfills will become increasingly less necessary with widespread adoption of best practices such as composting food waste instead of throwing it away and thus contributing to methane release . lastly but certainly not leastly is air quality burning fossil fuels releases toxic substances into the atmosphere which can cause respiratory diseases however when recyclables are collected they don t get burned so they do not contribute to air pollution at all!. on a personal level, taking part in regular donation or collection drives can help foster community connectivity getting together with neighbors and friends while helping out those who may not have access to these same privileges provides everyone involved an opportunity learn about their local environment while giving back at the same time! and finally making a commitment towards becoming more eco conscious gives us all something positive to focus on during challenging times feeling empowered knowing our small contributions truly",0,0,0.0006431283233767885

"the electoral college is an outdated system that needs to be abolished. it no longer serves its original purpose and it is time for america to move to a popular vote system. this is the claim made by many critics of the electoral college, but i strongly disagree. i believe that the electoral college is an important aspect of our democracy, and it should be kept. one reason for keeping the electoral college is that it protects the interests of smaller states. in a purely popular vote system, the large states with more people would dominate the election. this would mean that the smaller states would not have much of a say in who becomes president. the electoral college ensures that every state has a voice in the election, and that is important. another reason for keeping the electoral college is that it promotes stability in the election process. in a popular vote system, there is the potential for a very close election, which could lead to a recount and a long and drawn out legal battle. this could create chaos and uncertainty, which is not good for our democracy. the electoral college helps to prevent this by providing a clear winner on election day. finally, the electoral college is rooted in our history and tradition. it has been used to elect every president in our nation s history, and it has served us well. it is a unique aspect of our political system, and it helps to distinguish us from other democracies around the world. we should not be too quick to abandon a system that has been a part of our democracy for over two centuries. while it is true that the electoral college has faced criticism, i believe that the criticisms are overblown. yes, there have been some close elections and some controversies, but these are the exceptions rather than the rule. for the most part, the electoral college has worked well and has provided us with stable and fair elections. in conclusion, i urge you to support the electoral college and to resist any efforts to abolish it. it is an important part of our democracy, and it serves a valuable purpose. we should be proud of it and we should work to protect it. thank you for your time and consideration.",0,0,0.0036057339211063677

"being inactive a double edged sword in today's fast paced world, it's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of daily life. we're constantly on the go, whether it's rushing to school, work, or extracurricular activities. however, it's important to remember that being inactive can serve a purpose, as long as it's done in moderation. in this essay, i will examine three key benefits of being inactive, explain how it can be beneficial in small doses, give an example of a time when inactivity helped me complete tasks, and investigate how hiring a butler or household assistant can help with inactivity. firstly, being inactive can provide much needed rest. in our busy lives, it's easy to overlook the importance of rest. however, it's essential for our physical and mental health. when we're inactive, our bodies are able to repair and rejuvenate, which can lead to increased productivity and energy levels when we're back on the go. for example, after a long day at school, it's important to take some time to relax and unwind. this could mean watching tv, reading a book, or simply taking a nap. by giving ourselves permission to be inactive, we're allowing our bodies to rest and recover. secondly, being inactive can be a great way to catch up on tv shows or movies. in today's digital age, there are countless streaming services available that allow us to watch our favorite shows and movies at the touch of a button. this can be a great way to unwind and relax after a long day. for example, after finishing a particularly challenging math test, i decided to take a break and watch an episode of my favorite tv show. this allowed me to decompress and clear my mind before diving back into studying. lastly, being inactive can be a great way to hire a butler or household assistant. while this may seem like an extravagant luxury, it can actually be quite beneficial. a butler or household assistant can take care of tasks such as cleaning, cooking, and running errands, which can free up valuable time for other activities. for example, if you have a busy work schedule, hiring a butler or household assistant can help",0,0,4.148230270839121e-05

"venus, the second planet from the sun, is often referred to as earth's sister planet. it has a similar size and mass to earth, and both share similarities in composition. however, venus is a unique planet with its own fascinating features and mysteries waiting to be explored. venus' atmosphere venus has an extremely thick atmosphere, composed mostly of carbon dioxide with small amounts of nitrogen. the atmospheric pressure on the surface is about 90 times that of earth, which makes it difficult for spacecraft to withstand and land. the dense atmosphere also contributes to the planet's extremely hot surface temperature. exploring venus' atmosphere despite these challenges, scientists have managed to send various spacecraft to venus to gather valuable information about its atmosphere. some of these probes were designed to measure the atmospheric composition, temperature, and pressure. they also studied the presence of various chemical elements, including sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide, which contribute to the planet's extreme weather. the soviet union's venera missions were the first to successfully land on venus' surface, starting in 1967. these missions were followed by nasa's pioneer venus mission, launched in 1978, which orbited the planet for several months. more recently, nasa's magellan spacecraft orbited venus between 1990 and 1994, using synthetic aperture radar to map the planet's surface. future exploration of venus as technology advances, there is potential for future missions to explore the planet's surface and atmosphere in greater depth. one possible mission concept is the high altitude venus operational concept havoc . this mission would involve sending a balloon like aircraft to float in venus' dense atmosphere, studying its composition and weather patterns from high altitude. another idea is sending a lander to the surface, which would have to withstand the extreme conditions and be able to transmit data back to earth. such a mission would require advancements in materials, technology, and engineering. venus remains a fascinating planet, full of mysteries waiting to be uncovered. as we continue to explore the solar system and push the limits of technology, it is likely we will send more spacecraft to venus to learn more about its atmosphere, surface, and history.",0,0,0.002872312474963628
"as we all know, cars have become an essential part of our daily lives, providing us with a quick and easy way of transportation. however, with the increasing number of cars on the road, there are many advantages to limiting car usage, which can benefit our environment, health, and even our wallets. one of the biggest advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on the environment. cars are one of the leading contributors to air pollution, releasing harmful gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter into the atmosphere. by reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly reduce air pollution levels, which in turn can improve the overall air quality and reduce the risk of respiratory diseases. furthermore, limiting car usage also promotes a healthier lifestyle. instead of relying on cars for transportation, people are encouraged to walk, bike, or use public transportation. this not only provides an opportunity for exercise but also helps to reduce stress levels and improve mental health. additionally, by reducing the number of cars on the road, we also reduce the risk of accidents and injuries, making our roads safer for everyone. finally, limiting car usage can also be beneficial for our wallets. cars are expensive to maintain, requiring regular maintenance, repairs, and fuel. by reducing car usage, we can save money on gas, maintenance, and even insurance premiums. furthermore, by using public transportation, we can also save money on parking fees, tolls, and other expenses associated with car ownership. in conclusion, limiting car usage can have many advantages for our environment, health, and wallets. by reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality, promote a healthier lifestyle, and save money. so, let's all do our part and consider alternative forms of transportation, such as walking, biking, or using public transportation, to create a better and healthier future for ourselves and generations to come.",0,0,3.4813848166777003e-06
"im agree with the five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president. this is my claim, a dipute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible it happened in 2000, but it's likely than a dispute over the popular vote. the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. for example, president obama recive 61.7 percent of the electoral votes copared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes for him and for romney. because the total number of votes 538 is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. the winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates, to focus on their campaign the voters in toss up states are more likely to pay close attention to the competing candidates. the electoral college restores some of the weigth on the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. the most popular vote was in florida in 2012. who won the vote, got 29 electoral votes. so other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates ina campaign tahn a small state. nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral college the 301 and 370 electoral votes, repectively. there is pressure for run off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast that pressure, which of would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the electoral college, which invariably produces a clear winner. democrats in texas, and reublicans in california. thir vote no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the compaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. but of course no voter's vote swings a national election, about one half the elegible american population did vote in 2012's election.",1,1,0.9850935522553698

"introduction venus is a planet that has always intrigued us. it is similar in size and mass to earth, but its atmosphere is very different. the surface of venus is also hidden from view, making it a mystery that scientists have long wanted to unravel. but exploring venus is not easy. the atmosphere is hostile, and the surface temperature can reach up to 462 degrees celsius. despite these dangers, the author of the challenge of exploring venus believes that studying venus is a worthy pursuit. in this essay, i will evaluate how well the author supports this idea. body the author provides several reasons why studying venus is important. firstly, venus is the closest planet to earth that can support life. the author states that venus is the only planet in our solar system that comes close to earth in terms of size and mass. this means that studying venus can help us understand how life on earth evolved and whether it is possible for life to exist on other planets. secondly, the author argues that studying venus can help us understand the effects of climate change. the author states that venus has a runaway greenhouse effect that has made its surface a scorching escape. by studying the atmosphere and surface of venus, scientists can gain insights into how earth's climate might change in the future. this is important because it can help us prepare for the consequences of climate change and find ways to mitigate its effects. thirdly, the author suggests that studying venus can help us develop new technologies. the author states that the challenges of exploring venus have led to the development of new technologies, such as advanced materials and propulsion systems. by pushing the boundaries of what is possible in space exploration, scientists can develop new technologies that can benefit society in many ways. conclusion in conclusion, the author of the challenge of exploring venus provides strong evidence to support the idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. the author highlights the importance of understanding how life on earth evolved, the effects of climate change, and the development of new technologies. these reasons make it clear that the challenges of exploring venus are worth the risks. i agree with the author that studying venus is a valuable pursuit and hope that scientists will continue to explore this fascinating planet.",0,0,0.1610463571379935
"have you ever wondered or wanted to take your school classes at home? well i feel students would benefit from taking classes at home because its more comfortable for students and it's less stress on a student. a way students will benefit from taking their classes at home is it will be more comfortable for them. for example, a reason why so many kids do not like going to school is getting up early and sitting in plastic shares for most of the day, but if the students were at home they would not have to worry about sitting in plastic shares or getting up early, and they would feel more relief when they are learning. this shows that students will benefit off taking classes at home by being able to relax to give them a better work ethic. another way students will benefit from taking their classes at home is it will be less stress on the students. for example, turning in assignments late is a big issue most students have but when this is done electronically over an computer work is easy to obtain and turn in because the students will not have to keep up with all paper printed assignments when it is on computer for them. this show that kids will benefit off taking classes by the students being more focus on task and responsible for the assignments they turn in through computer at home. some people think that students are better off taking classes from school. however, those people are wrong because most students in general do not like school. unlike school, students will benefit from taking classes at home because all they have to worry about is finishing the work which is why students would like home school better. for example, students will be more determined if the yuan get the assignments done and move on to something they wanted to do and them not having to worry about a teacher telling them get off the phone the idea is to get the students to want to learn. its more comfortable and less stressful for students to take classes from home. these are the benefits from taking classes from home. principal please consider these ideas for the students and maybe make an change. thank you.",1,1,0.9937565910763102
"title the face on mars a mystery unraveled introduction the face on mars is a fascinating phenomenon observed on the surface of the red planet. this mysterious formation has sparked numerous debates, theories, and even conspiracies, captivating both scientists and the general public alike. in this essay, i will discuss the origin and significance of this mysterious feature, and attempt to unravel the mystery behind the famous face on mars. the history first discovered by the viking 1 orbiter in 1976, the face on mars is a rock formation that resembles a human face when viewed from a certain angle and under certain lighting conditions. its distinctive features include a forehead, a nose, two eyes, and a mouth. the face's dimensions are approximately 340 feet 103 meters long, 140 feet 43 meters high, and 110 feet 33 meters wide. initial theories initially, many speculated that this face was a result of extraterrestrial life or intelligent design, suggesting that this might be evidence of ancient alien civilizations. however, further investigations revealed that the face is not an isolated feature, but a part of a much larger, geological formation known as the cydonia mensae. scientific explanation as more images and data were collected, researchers began to propose more plausible explanations for the face. one theory suggested that it was a result of natural geological processes, such as erosion, wind, or even a combination of these factors. in 1998, a team led by dr. richard hoover, an astrobiologist from nasa, conducted an extensive analysis on the face. they found that the face's features, such as the eyes and mouth, were formed due to a natural process involving the weathering and erosion of the martian terrain. conclusion while the face on mars remains an intriguing and captivating phenomenon, the scientific community has largely debunked extraterrestrial or intelligent design theories. the most plausible explanation for this geological feature is its formation through natural processes. the discovery highlighted the importance of further exploration and research in understanding our celestial neighbor, mars.",0,0,0.00673368228702816

"dear state senator, i think that we should change the election by popular vote for the president of the united states instead of keeping the electoral college. the reasons i think that we should have it changed to the popular vote is because i think the people should be able to choose who should be our next president instead of having the electoral college also voting for the president of the united states. its not only me senator, but also these important men of our country all agree with me that we need to abolish the electoral college! these men are richard nixon, jimmy carter, bob dole, and the u.s. chamber of commerce. the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. i just find all of this unfair because its not just the united states giving there opinion on who should be there next leader but some other men who have favoritism for the opponents also vote too! one example of how i think the electoral college voters are unfair is back in the election of president obama and mr. rodney the electoral voters had 29 electoral votes for obama and rodney only had 3. so, that election could have been more fair if we didnt have so much favoritism for one person to another. when we could have had a fair vote from the people and had the opinions on who should be there next president. now, in the defese of the electoral college it does help situations in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast which can be very helpful when examples happen like nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 when they both had only 43 percent of the popular votes and the electoral college helped not make those elections as complicated. but, they still had a say so on who should be president and who shouldnt be president. i think that question should be answered by our own people! thank you so much state senator for reading my opinion on the electoral college versus the popular vote for the president of the united states.",1,1,0.9951177130404353
"i think summer projects should be saudenadesigned. ia's important for students ao have ahe opportunity ao make ownership of their learning and develop skills in self directed learning. when students are given ahe freedom ao design their own projects, aha are able ao explore their interests and passions, and learn aa their own pace. this can lead ao a much more engaging and effective learning experience. for example, i know a student who was really interested in photography. he decided ao create a photography portfolio for his summer project. he spent ahe summer making pictures of different scenes and objects, editing ahem, and creating a website ao showcase his work. noa only did he improve his photography skills, bua he also learned how ao build a website, which is a valuable skill in today's digital age. on ahe other hand, when teachers design summer projects, aha can sometimes be aoo structured and rigid. students may feel like aha are being forced ao work on something ahab doesn'ta interest ahem, which can lead ao a negative learning experience. additionally, aeacherdesigned projects may noa make into account individual students' learning sales and interests, which can result in an onesizefiasall approach ahab doesn'ta effective for everyone. of course, their are some potential drawbacks ao saudenadesigned projects. some students may struggle with self directed learning and may noa pua in enough effort or may noa know where ao sahara. in these cases, teacher guidance and support can be helpful. teachers can provide resources and feedback ao help students say on track and ensure ahab their projects are rigorous and meaningful. in conclusion, saudenadesigned summer projects provide students with ahe opportunity ao make ownership of their learning, explore their interests, and develop valuable skills. with ahe right balance of student autonomy and teacher guidance, summer projects can be a powerful pool for student growth and development.",0,0,4.7909392146319125e-05
"when debating the merits of instituting a curfew for teens, it's important to look at both the pros and cons of such a rule. on the positive side, having a curfew can help to ensure that teens are safe and in a secure environment at night, restricting the potential to engage in risky behaviors such as drinking, drug use, or being on the streets with potential predators. additionally, a curfew could encourage more responsible spending on the part of teens by forcing them to stay home and increasing the amount of time spent on studying, sleeping, and engaging in other positive, healthy activities. on the other hand, enforcing a curfew could have some drawbacks. for instance, it could stifle creativity and socializing amongst teens, as they may feel more confined and restricted to their homes. imposing a curfew could also undermine parent child relationships, leading to an increased feeling of mistrust on both sides. furthermore, a curfew rule could be difficult to enforce, as police officers would have to take time away from more important duties such as patrolling the streets and responding to emergencies. ultimately, it is important to evaluate both the pros and cons of implementing a curfew rule for teens before making a decision. although there may be some potential benefit to this policy, it is important to consider the potential downsides and determine if the pros outweigh the cons.",0,0,2.152077448221758e-07
"dear principal, i think students should have to to community service. in my opinion community service helps kids become better citizens. first, let's say someone is cleaning up litter as community service. by cleaning a park or the playground at a school the community would seem like a clean place to live. more people would be interested in moving here. they would think, 'look at how clean it is!' or, 'what a great place to live'. cleaning up trash as community service wouldn't only benefit our community, it would benefit our planet. we would help reduce pollution in the air anw global warming. someone who disagrees with me might say that kids should have an opinion on whether to to community service. but think of this how many kids actually want to to community service. would you have one community service as a kit, i think not. lastly, community service would give kids something to to in the afternoon. more kids would stay out of trouble. less kids would spent their afternoon playing video games. i honestly think that community service would have a positive effect on students. sincerely, an anonymous learner",1,1,0.9736082191192394
"every theory needs to have proof, or else no one will want to believe the idea. theories though, are just ideas or thoughts people have. it's hard to link a daydream to scientific facts. the statement that the face was created by aliens is nonsense. there are no facts to back the idea up. aliens haven't even been proved to be real! people need to understand that the face is just a mesa, a type of landform that be found on earth as well. if the aliens were real, don't you think something would have changed by now? there is absolutely no sign of any life near the mesa not even on the planet. if the aliens did exist then we should have noticed some sign. the statement that the face is only a landform is clearly correct, unlike the idea that creatures formed it into mars. the statement that the face is just a mesa has lots of proof to back it up. there are many sets of pictures, including the pictures from the original viking itself. the viking was the spaceship on mars that helped capture the landform on camera. there are also pictures from recent explorations that further prove that the face is just a landform. i think one of the reasons people like to dream up conspiracies is because of the other ideas spread by celebrities. people like talk show hosts spread there ideas for large groups of people to hear, causing people to further think on those ideas. plus the movie that was made about the face doesn't help by mixing the facts up. if i were to give you one piece of advice it would be to stick to the facts. late night dreams won't get you far in a lab or other place of scientific study. the face is just a landform, nothing more, nothing less.",1,1,0.9990680124684349

"the free of mars was not created by aliens. the free is a mesa, an elevated piece of land similar to a plateau. the mesa is about 2 miles long, and the free is created by the shadows from protruding rock. the features of this landform would have been created by aliens if they had the ability to earle a two mile long mesa to look like a free, not knowing what it looked like while they were earning it. since they were on the ground they we earning, they would have had to either but into the rock blindly, or have a method to see what the free looked like. that method, be it mechanical or optical should still be visible. the aliens might not be humanoid, and might not know what a human free looked like. they wouldn't be able to but out an image of something if they don't know what it looks like. even if aliens would but a free into the rock, there would be fragments of that rock lying all around the base of the landform. most of the debris might be swept away over time, but there would still be some. if the earning was done by aliens, they would have to have some way to get on top of the mesa, and that might be visible. it would be stairs, or a ladder, or a rope, but it should be visible to the satellite pictures. if the aliens did but the free into the mesa, then if they would have gone about it differently. assuming that the aliens created the free is assuming that they are intelligent beings. intelligent beings would most likely have created finer details or earned a symbol or word to show who created the free. if they are unintelligent beings, how did they get on top of the mesa and how did they but out the free.",1,1,0.9894045938115863

"in a world that constantly tells us to change who we are in order to fit in, it can be easy to forget what makes us unique and individual. however, being true to ourselves and our own interests allows us to embark on wondrous journeys that others might not embark upon. for example, if we ignored the pressures of society to conform, we might choose to visit awe inspiring places like a lush green forest, a secluded mountain valley, or a magnificent waterfall. being true to ourselves also opens us up to understanding life in a different way, because nature is beautiful and ever changing. it can show us how fragile and fleeting our lives can be, but also how lasting and purposeful that life can be if we are ourselves. ralph waldo emerson was well known for stating that to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment . i could not agree more with this statement. when we stay true to ourselves and dismiss the external pressures of society, we are able to find and explore new parts of ourselves we never thought possible. we hone our individual skills and abilities, and discover our true passions. we can accept life on our own terms, and be content with who we are and where we are going. by staying true to ourselves, we can accomplish great things.",0,0,0.00030439898129344396

"innovation has been the driving force of humanity since the earliest days. it has been the key to our success, allowing us to achieve things that were previously thought to be impossible. it is often said that innovation is the result of a team effort. while it is true that a team can provide ideas and support, it is ultimately the individual who has the ideas, the drive, and the creativity to bring them to fruition. an individual is the impetus for innovation because only an individual can come up with the initial idea. it takes an individual to recognize a need, generate a creative solution, and then take the steps to make it a reality. just look at some of the greatest innovators in history, from nikola tesla to steve jobs. these individuals had creative minds that allowed them to see possibilities in technology and culture that no one else did. they had a vision that no one else saw and then took the steps to make it a reality. a team can play a role in innovation, however, as it can provide ideas and support. for example, a team can brainstorm ideas, provide feedback on solutions, and help to bring the idea to a successful completion. no one person can do all of this alone, which is why teams are important. however, the team relies on the individual to come up with the initial concept and the drive to make it a reality. in addition, an individual s unique perspective and experience are essential for innovation. everyone has their own experiences, knowledge, and skills that shape the way they view the world. this can lead to unique ideas that no one else has thought of. for example, let s say a person has experience in automotive engineering and the medical field. they could combine the two to create a new medical device that would revolutionize the way medical procedures are performed. this combination of knowledge and creativity would have never been possible without the individual s unique perspective. in conclusion, it is always an individual who is the impetus for innovation. it takes an individual to have the initial idea, the drive to make it a reality, and the unique perspective to see possibilities that no one else can. while teams can provide ideas and support, it is ultimately the individual who makes the innovation a success.",0,0,0.005554105151560189

"i think we should transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy because it's better for the environment and will help us in the long run. firstly, renewable energy sources like solar panels and wind turbines don't produce harmful greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. fossil fuels, on the other hand, do produce these gases and are a major cause of global warming. by switching to renewable energy, we can reduce our carbon footprint and help protect the planet for future generations. in addition, renewable energy is becoming increasingly affordable and efficient. the cost of solar panels has dropped significantly in recent years, making it more accessible for households and businesses. wind turbines are also becoming more efficient, which means they can generate more electricity using less wind. this makes renewable energy a smart investment both financially and environmentally. furthermore, renewable energy can create jobs and boost the economy. as more people switch to solar panels and wind turbines, there will be a greater demand for workers who can install and maintain these systems. this means more jobs and economic growth. in conclusion, the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is important for our planet's health, our economy, and our future. we should invest in renewable energy and work towards a cleaner, greener future.",0,0,1.6322814518977242e-07

"driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles avs , represent a new era of transportation that has captured the imagination of many. they are designed to operate without the need for human drivers and rely on various technological advancements, including sensors, cameras, radar, and global positioning systems gps . one of the key advantages of driverless cars is improved safety. human errors account for a significant portion of traffic accidents, and avs eliminate this risk factor. they can react faster and more accurately to changing road conditions, reducing the potential for collisions. moreover, avs can help reduce traffic congestion, pollution, and parking problems in urban areas. they have the ability to optimize traffic flow by communicating with each other, thereby reducing traffic jams. this, in turn, can lead to reduced fuel consumption and emissions, which is beneficial for the environment. driverless cars can also provide greater accessibility to transportation, especially for those with disabilities or limited mobility. the vehicles can be programmed to accommodate specific needs, such as wheelchair ramps or braille displays. this could potentially transform the lives of people with disabilities by enabling them to enjoy greater independence. furthermore, driverless cars could potentially alleviate the issue of driver fatigue and distractions, as they can continuously operate without the need for breaks or rest. this could lead to increased productivity during long journeys and reduce the risk of accidents caused by driver exhaustion or inattention. however, there are still concerns surrounding the widespread adoption of driverless cars, including privacy and security issues, as well as potential challenges related to the integration of these vehicles into existing road infrastructures. it is essential for the development of avs to address these concerns and ensure that they are safe, secure, and reliable before they can be fully embraced by the general public. in conclusion, while driverless cars offer numerous benefits in terms of safety, efficiency, accessibility, and productivity, their widespread adoption will require addressing the various concerns associated with them. as technology continues to advance, it is likely that driverless cars will play an increasingly significant role in our transportation systems, potentially reshaping the way we live and commute.",0,0,2.059729866027394e-05

"what's wrong with the electoral college is that voters do not vote for the president, they vote for a slate of electors who, in turn, elect the president. the electors can be anyone not holding public office. to be picked depends on the state, some have conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the president pivked the electors themselves. the disaster factor is when we vote the electors can change their mind, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for who ever they pleased. i feel changing to election by popular vote is better because if a president wins, its because more people voted for him, not an elector. the electoral college is unfair to voters because the winner take all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in state they have no chance of winning. in an event of a tie, the election would be thrown to the house of representives, where the state delegations would vote on the president, and the senate would choose the vice president. in 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in ohio and 3,687 voters in hwaii had voted the oter way. the election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe. the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.",1,1,0.9999133133079142
"there is r longstanding debate over whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate. some people believe that competition is necessary for children to learn to succeed in life, while others argue that cooperation is essential for their personal and social development. in my opinion, while competition hrs it's advantages, cooperation should be the primary focus of children's education. firstly, cooperation helps children develop important social skills, such rs communication, empathy, and teamwork. when children learn to work together towards r common goal, they learn how to take turns, listen to others, and compromise. these skills are crucial for building positive relationships with others and for success in adulthood. moreover, cooperation encourages children to develop r sense of responsibility and accountability. when children work in groups, each member is responsible for their part, and they learn to take ownership of their work. on the other hand, competition crn have negative effects on children's self esteem and mental health. when children are constantly pitted against each other, they may feel like they are not good enough if they do not win. this crn lead to anxiety, low self esteem, and even depression. additionally, competition crn foster r hostile environment where children are more likely to bully or belittle each other. however, there are some benefits to competition when it is used in moderation. competition crn motivate children to work harder and strive for excellence. it crn also teach them to handle failure and disappointment, which are important life skills. when children learn to lose gracefully, they develop resilience and perseverance. in conclusion, while competition hrs some advantages, cooperation should be the primary focus of children's education. cooperation helps children develop important social skills, r sense of responsibility, and accountability. moreover, it fosters r positive learning environment where children feel supported and valued. while teaching children to compete may have some benefits, it'should be used in moderation and balanced with cooperation.",0,0,2.9683552690508623e-06
"i strongly believe that transitioning the traditional fourier high school education to a threader graduation system would be beneficial, particularly for latino students. i can personally attest to this, as a latina graham fellow who graduated high school in three instead of four years. as someone who comes from a low income family, i was able to save money and time by finishing my studies in a shorter period. moreover, having the opportunity to expedite my studies has given me more time to pursue my higher education goals. the accelerated education system could help five latino youth a much needed socioeconomic boost by putting them on a faster track to success. statistics show that fewer latinos tend to attend college and to finish college than other population groups, and this is in part due to the economic barriers they face. with a threader graduation system, they would be able to start their college careers earlier and increase their chances of achieving greater success in the long run. on the other hand, the accelerated system could also be potentially detrimental to certain students. they might lack the skills and resources to keep up with such a demanding schedule and may struggle to adjust to the fast pace environment. additionally, some might feel pressured to complete their studies even if they are not ready, leading to deficiencies in their education and potential lower grades. ultimately, i think the threader high school graduation system has the potential to be very beneficial. it could open doors for many latino students who cannot afford to take four years to complete their studies. when done correctly, this accelerated educational system could positively impact the hispanic community by providing them with the skills and resources needed to succeed.",0,0,7.748644484250457e-05

"a step in the right direction cars are a great means of transportation. unfortunately nothing is perfect. cars have many advantages, and like everything, disadvantages too. people rely too heavily on their private vehicles especially with the easy accessibility of public transportation. limiting the use of cars limits pollution, which is a growing issue among many people. among that, there are many other advantages too. limiting the use of cars is certainly a step in the right direction. as the ice near the voles shrink, the problem of global warming grows. global warming has been linked to car emissions. limiting cars will limit emissions of harmful gasses into the air. sadly people seem to like their cars more than the environment. this is unfortunate because there are so many other ways to get around. for some reason people are just too close minded trying something else. if the amount of cars on the road shrinks, then the amount of pollution going into our environment will follow. carefree days in major cities is a good way to get the carefree trend started. with large turnouts, it certainly gets people oven to the idea source 3 . saying that, this will not work long term. getting the ball rolling and keeping the ball rolling are two completely different things. car free cities is a better long term strategy source 1 . now lets talk about our economy. most people probably wish it was a little better. jobs make a strong economy. if people didn't have cars they would be in need of some public transportation. instead of saying that monthly payment on your car, go take the bus. the demand for public transportation would rise immensely thus the supply would follow opening more jobs. all in all, limiting the use of cars has more advantages than disadvantages. most of the potential problems could be easily fixed with a bit of brain power. opening more jobs and cleaning uv the environment should be reasoned enough to switch over to a carefree lifestyle.",1,1,0.9961318546444475
"as an eighth grade student, i believe that it is important for our school to have a volunteer program in which older students help younger students identify their classes and work on their assignments. this program would not only benefit the younger students by providing them with guidance and support, but it would also provide the older students with valuable opportunities to give back to their community and develop important leadership skills. one of the main benefits of this program would be the ability for younger students to easily identify their classes and find the resources they need to succeed. this can be a particularly challenging task for students who are new to the school or who are struggling to navigate the complex layout of the building. by having older students available to help, these students would be able to quickly and easily find their way to their classes and get started on their assignments. in addition to providing guidance on identifying classes and finding resources, the program would also provide opportunities for the younger students to work on their assignments with the help of the older students. this would be particularly beneficial for students who are struggling with a particular subject or who are having difficulty staying organized. by working with an older student, these students would be able to get additional support and guidance, which could help them to improve their grades and achieve their full potential. in addition to the benefits for the students, this program would also provide valuable opportunities for the older students to give back to their community and develop important leadership skills. by volunteering their time to help the younger students, these students would be able to develop a sense of empathy and compassion for others, as well as the ability to effectively communicate and lead others. these are skills that will serve them well in the future, both in their personal and professional lives. overall, i believe that a volunteer program at our school in which older students help younger students identify their classes and work on their assignments would be a valuable and beneficial addition to our school community. it would provide important support and guidance for the younger students, as well as valuable opportunities for the older students to give back and develop important leadership skills. i hope that our school will consider implementing this program.",0,0,9.137754490902189e-05
"as a 6th grader, i believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. firstly, using a cell phone while driving is a major distraction. when drivers are texting, talking, or browsing on their phones, they are not paying attention to the road and the other cars around them. this can lead to accidents, which can cause injuries or even death. in fact, according to the national highway traffic safety administration, distracted driving was responsible for 3,166 deaths in the united states in 2017. secondly, using a cell phone while driving is a dangerous habit that can lead to addiction. many people feel the need to constantly check their phones for messages, notifications, or social media updates. this can be tempting for drivers, especially during long road trips or in heavy traffic. however, this habit can be deadly, as it takes the driver's focus away from the road and their surroundings. furthermore, using a cell phone while driving is illegal in many places. in some states, it is against the law to text and drive, while in others, it is illegal to use a hand held electronic device while driving. these laws are in place because lawmakers recognize the dangers of distracted driving and want to protect the public from its risks. finally, there are alternatives to using a cell phone while driving. for example, drivers can use hands free devices, such as bluetooth headsets or car speakers, to make and receive calls. they can also use voice to text technology to send messages or make calls without having to physically handle their phones. additionally, many cars now come equipped with built in infotainment systems that allow drivers to access their phones' features without having to physically handle their devices. in conclusion, using a cell phone while driving is a dangerous and distracting habit that can lead to accidents and fatalities. it is illegal in many places and there are alternatives available that allow drivers to stay connected without putting themselves or others at risk. therefore, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.",0,0,0.011094444618087933

"the electoral college is a system used to elect the president of the united states. it consists of 538 electors from each state and the district of columbia, with each state's number of electors determined by their total number of members in congress both the house of representatives and the senate . in this system, each state's electoral votes are awarded to the candidate who wins the popular vote within that state. the candidate with the majority of electoral votes becomes president. the question of whether the electoral college works or not is a complex issue with both pros and cons. some argue that the electoral college helps maintain a sense of unity among all states, as it ensures that smaller states are not overshadowed by larger states. additionally, it prevents a candidate from winning solely based on their popularity in one or two highly populated states. on the other hand, critics argue that the electoral college can lead to unrepresentative results, especially when the popular vote and electoral vote do not align. in the 2016 presidential election, for example, hillary clinton won the popular vote but donald trump became president due to the electoral college. furthermore, the electoral college system can be manipulated, such as through the gerrymandering of congressional districts. overall, whether the electoral college works or not depends on your perspective and values. it does have some advantages, such as maintaining a balance between states and preventing a candidate from winning solely based on popularity, but also has disadvantages, like potentially leading to unrepresentative results and being open to manipulation. the electoral college is a part of american democracy, and its effectiveness will always be a topic of debate in the political sphere.",0,0,0.00023394906501595847

"advertising has become an integral part of our culture, with companies using it to promote their products and services. while advertisements can be informative and entertaining, there is a debate about whether or not they make products seem better than they really are. in my opinion, advertisements often make products seem much better than they really are. to begin with, advertisements often use persuasive techniques to make a product appear more attractive to consumers. for example, advertisers may use words like new , improved and exclusive to make a product seem more appealing. they may also use images of celebrities or beautiful models to suggest that the product is associated with glamour and success. these techniques are designed to make a product appear more attractive than it actually is, and can be misleading for consumers. furthermore, advertisements often exaggerate the benefits of a product. companies may make exaggerated claims about the performance of their product, or suggest that it can do things that it actually can t. for example, a shampoo advertisement may claim that it can make your hair shinier and softer than ever before , when in reality it may only make a small difference. these exaggerated claims can lead consumers to purchase a product that does not live up to their expectations. finally, advertisements often fail to mention the drawbacks of a product. companies may focus on the positive aspects of their product and downplay any negative aspects. this can lead consumers to purchase a product without being aware of any potential problems. for example, an advertisement for a new laptop may not mention the fact that it has a short battery life, leaving consumers unaware of this issue until after they have purchased the product. in conclusion, i believe that advertisements often make products seem much better than they really are. advertisers use persuasive techniques to make a product appear more attractive, exaggerate the benefits of the product, and fail to mention any potential drawbacks. as a result, consumers can be misled into purchasing products that do not meet their expectations.",0,0,3.952663426593997e-06
"the law of conservation of energy is a cornerstone concept in physics and science in general. it states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but rather it can only change forms. this law has been used to explain phenomena from the smallest particles to stars and galaxies, inspiring countless scientific discoveries throughout history. recently, this discovery has also been applied to more everyday situations as well, such as personal finance and sustainability efforts. the law of conservation of energy states that if one form of energy is lost due to some process such as heat dissipation , then an equal amount must become available in another form such as mechanical work . in terms of finances, this means that although money may come into your life through income sources like a paycheck or gift cards it will eventually leave you through costs associated with living expenses like rent and food. therefore instead of thinking about managing money solely on an income basis it's important to understand how spending habits influence savings over time. for example, if you want to save for retirement or build wealth then learning how to live below your means will go a long way towards reaching those goals sooner than later since not all money coming in needs to go out so quickly!. . sustainability initiatives are increasingly reliant on the understanding that resources should not be wasted unnecessarily since they are limited something which can easily be understood by applying the law of conservation of energy principle no matter what we do with resources today they won't increase tomorrow unless we make them renewable or find ways for them replenish themselves over time which often involves significant effort . by being mindful about how our actions affect both current future generations individuals have greater power when making decisions regarding their lifestyle choices because they know these decisions could potentially impact everyone down the line. overall, the law of conservation of energy provides us with insight into many aspects of our lives including financial planning and sustainability practices alike enabling us thoughtfully consider our present actions plan strategically for future outcomes without",0,0,0.00037613585401843793
"i agree with the plan of having an afterschool homework club. because some students have a hard time finishing homework by themselves and if teachers stay with the students to help them finish their homework that would be amazing because that would mean less students failing. also some kids might not have computers or any electronic device in their houses. although if their is no afterschool homework club that may be good because students cant get help from any teachers and that could be good because they can know that not everything in life is easy unless you are good at it or try your best and your hardest. another good reason that i think might be good for having afterschool homework clubs is that sudnets get a chance to enteract with other students and they also get a chance to veiw or examine how the other students do their own homework. some kids migh take advantage of having afterschool homework club by cheating the answers off of somebody and then leaving. so i think if the afterschool homework club shouldn't let students look at each others work until they are done. and some kids may take it as fun club and talk through the whole thing. but there is always the kids that do what they are supposed to do. they do not play around,joke around, and distract anyone from doing what they are supposed to do. so, at the end i think that there should be an afterschool homework club because there is more details to back it up then there is for backing up not having the afterschool homework program. and alot of kids could change their work habbit and not get as much as bad grades. and mostly kids who care about their grades would want to join so there is high chance that kid do what they are supposed to do. but not having an afterschool homework program would mean that kids that really need to improve their grades would have a chance to do so and would have a chance to finish then grade they're in with good grades to start of for their next year.",1,1,0.9999609707147392

"education is one of the most powerful tools that can transform individuals and societies. it is a key factor in shaping the future of any nation. however, the impact of education on boys and girls is not the same. in many societies, girls are often denied access to education, which has far reaching consequences for their families and the nation as a whole. in this essay, i will argue that educating girls has a greater impact on families and nations than educating boys. firstly, educating girls has a positive impact on families. girls who receive an education are more likely to marry later, have fewer children, and provide better care for their families. educated girls are also more likely to be aware of their rights and have the confidence to stand up for themselves and their families. for example, in many african countries, girls who are educated are less likely to be subjected to female genital mutilation, child marriage, and other harmful practices. educated girls are also more likely to pass on their knowledge and skills to their children, creating a cycle of education and empowerment. secondly, educating girls has a positive impact on nations. girls who receive an education are more likely to participate in the workforce and contribute to the economy. educated girls are also more likely to be involved in politics and decision making, which can lead to more inclusive and equitable policies. for example, in rwanda, where girls' education has been prioritized, women now hold more than half of the seats in parliament. this has led to policies that promote gender equality, such as laws against gender based violence and equal pay for men and women. in contrast, educating boys has a more individual impact. boys who receive an education are more likely to have better job opportunities and earn higher wages. however, the impact of their education on their families and the nation is not as significant as that of girls. boys are less likely to prioritize their families and communities over their individual interests. in conclusion, the african proverb if you educate a boy, you educate an individual if you educate a girl, you educate a family and a nation is true. educating girls has a greater impact on families and nations than educating boys. by investing in girls' education, we can create a more equitable and prosperous world for all.",0,0,2.3830504397788697e-06
"how can we explore venus? today many scientists are looking on how to get to venus and study it, researchers have been trying to find a way but had always failed. now they're still looking on what to do because the planet venus is really facinating and amazing for them. why does until today scientists keep wanting to visiting earth's twin venus ? because the planet itself is incredible. and it says it in the text in paragraph 4 that astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth like planet in ouir solar system. the studies that they researchers have made so far is that long ago, the planet venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. based on the text we can see that the next planet's fascinating, according to the passage it is really hard to get just one foot on venus, you won't even last a minute or more, we can see it's impossible to land on it. but that doesn't affect scientists. the writer said that it's a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets..., and the temperatures average are over 800 degrees farhenheit, the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. but it does not matter to them. in the fourth paragraph the writer state that the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and it includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. recall that venus can sometims be our nearest option for a planetary visit. the value of returning to venus seems indisputable for scientists, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive? that's the questions they're asking themselves until today. nasa have been testing some electronics made of silicon carbide at higher temperature in a chamber, the same as venus's, and it lasted for three weeks in those conditions, they're still believing in landing on venus, because human curiosity will lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. said the author.",1,1,0.9999904218696543

"title the face on mars the red planet has long fascinated humans, and the discovery of the so called face on mars only added fuel to the fire. it's an enigmatic feature that has captured the imagination of many and sparked debates over what it could mean. the face on mars was first spotted in 1976 by the viking 1 orbiter during its mission to explore mars. it appeared on images taken by the craft, and it immediately drew attention due to its striking resemblance to a human face. the feature consists of a large rock formation with two prominent, eye like structures, a distinct nose, and a mouth. it's located in a region of mars known as cydonia mensae, which lies near the martian equator. theories abound about the origin of the face on mars. some believe it could be a natural formation, such as wind or water erosion, while others think it's an artificial structure created by intelligent lifeforms. the nose of the face is believed to be a result of a crater within a crater, with the mouth and other features formed by erosion and weathering of rocks. this hypothesis suggests that it's a geological formation and not evidence of extraterrestrial life. however, some people are not convinced. they argue that the face on mars' resemblance to a human face and its location on the martian surface are too coincidental. they suggest that the feature could be a monument or even a message left by a long lost civilization on the red planet. in 2010, a team of researchers conducted a more detailed investigation of the area using data from the mars reconnaissance orbiter. their findings supported the natural formation theory, stating that the face was just an optical illusion formed by a combination of lighting and shadows. while the debate surrounding the face on mars is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon, it continues to intrigue people and inspire curiosity about what lies beyond our world. it's a reminder that there's still much to be discovered and understood in the vast expanse of our solar system.",0,0,0.0033994813437313483
"hello, this is generic name. i believe it is beneficial for schools to allow students to use cell phones in classrooms. firstly, cell phones can be useful in emergency situations. for instance, students can use their cell phones to call for help or to communicate with their parents or guardians in case of an emergency. additionally, cell phones can be used to access translation apps, which can be helpful for students who may not be proficient in the language being taught. secondly, cell phones can be used to complete assignments and tasks that are assigned on google classroom. this can be particularly helpful for students who do not have access to a computer or who have limited access to one. cell phones can also be used to access educational resources and apps that can aid in learning. thirdly, while it is true that some students may use their cell phones for inappropriate purposes, such as not paying attention in class or bullying others, i believe that schools can take measures to mitigate these issues. for example, schools can block certain apps or websites on cell phones to prevent students from accessing them during class. finally, cell phones can be a convenient tool for students to access information during class. for instance, if a teacher is too busy to answer a question, students can use their cell phones to look up the information on their own. in conclusion, while there may be some concerns about the use of cell phones in classrooms, i believe that the benefits outweigh the risks. by allowing students to use cell phones, schools can provide students with access to emergency situations, educational resources, and convenient tools for learning.",0,0,2.717464956557885e-05

"title the fallacy of failure exploring the concept through historical and modern examples introduction failure. the very word conjures sp feelings of disappointment, despair, and defeat. however, is failure truly a negative concept? can it be a stepping stone to success, as the famous saying goes? in this essay, i will delve into the reasons why the league of nations was considered a failure, analyze the accomplishments of the legendary soccer player pele, examine the reasons behind failed spaceship launches, and explore the arguments against the idea of failure being related to success. i will also examine how winston churchill's words reflect the role of failure and enthusiasm in success. the league of nations the league of nations, established after world war i, was created to promote peace and security in the world. however, it failed to prevent the second world war, and its inability to enforce its own decisions led to its downfall. the league's lack of military power, combined with the noncompliance of its member states, made it ineffective in addressing conflicts. despite its good intentions, the league of nations was ultimately a failure. pele pele, widely regarded as one of the greatest soccer players of all time, faced numerous setbacks throughout his career. he was born into poverty, had a difficult childhood, and suffered numerous injuries. however, he persevered and went on to win numerous championships, including three world csps. pele's determination and passion for the sport helped him overcome his challenges and achieve unparalleled success. failed spaceship launches numerous spaceship launches have ended in failure, often dse to technical glitches or design flaws. for example, the challenger space shuttle disintegrated just 73 seconds after launch in 1986, killing all seven crew members on board. the failure of these launches highlights the importance of careful planning and attention to detail in the pursuit of success. arguments against failure being related to success some argue that failure is not a necessary step towards success. they claim that success can be achieved through hard work, determination,",0,0,0.0025427736994503253
"ko you remember your last summer project? some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. summer projects should be teacher designed because they can choose challenging topics, make the project teach new material, and can grade the projects on their own rubric. student designed projects could be great since they can make how difficult it is for them, but this is not a good idea. a teacher designed summer project is the way to go because the teachers can choose how challenging the projects are for their students. for example, students would try to make their projects very easy for them to complete so that they could do less work, but this would not allow them to learn very much. teachers would make sure that the topic encourages the student to push themselves and use what they have learned throughout the school year to complete it. this way the students would not forget the material they have learned the past year and go into the next school year fresh and ready to go. secondly, teacher designed summer projects would be better because they can make the project teach new material. for instance, a math project could show the students how to use a new formula that will be needed for their next grade. in addition to using topics that they already know so that they won't be forgotten, the project could incorporate a new concept. in doing so, students could learn and use these new topics to help them smoothly transition into the new year. finally, the last reason why summer projects should be teacher designed is because they can grade them on their own rubric. for example, if students create their own summer projects then it would be a bit more complicated to grade their projects. if the teacher creates the project, then they can make sure that it meets certain criteria that would be needed. in conclusion, teacher designed summer projects would be far better than student designed summer projects because they can choose challenging topics, make the project teach new material, and can grade the projects on their own rubric. to whom it may concern, i strongly suggest that summer projects be, and stay, teacher designed.",1,1,0.971691092880694
"the electoral college is a system that has been in use for centuries to elect the president of the united states. it was established by the founding fathers as part of the united states constitution. the main purpose of the electoral college was to balance the interests of large and small states and to prevent a direct election of the president by the people. the electoral college consists of a group of electors who cast votes for president and vice president. each state is allocated a number of electoral votes based on the number of representatives they have in congress, plus three additional votes for their senators. the electors are chosen by the states and territories in different ways, including a combination of popular vote and legislature selection. the electoral college has both advantages and disadvantages. one advantage is that it ensures a fair distribution of electoral votes between large and small states. another is that it prevents a single candidate from winning the majority of popular votes while losing the election due to the electoral college. however, there are also drawbacks to the electoral college. one disadvantage is that it can result in the winner of the popular vote losing the presidential election. this has happened several times, such as in 2000 when al gore received more popular votes but lost to george w. bush in the electoral college. another issue is that the electoral college does not necessarily represent the will of the people, as electors may not vote for the candidate who wins the state popular vote. this happened in 2016 when a number of faithless electors voted against the candidate they were pledged to, causing some controversy. in conclusion, the electoral college works by ensuring representation of both large and small states, and by preventing a direct election of the president by the people. however, its drawbacks include the possibility of a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the election, and electors not representing the will of the state they are from. the electoral college remains a contentious and debated topic in american politics, with some advocating for its reform or abolition, and others defending its original purpose.",0,0,0.00979353685084256

"dear state representative, as a concerned citizen of our great state, i am writing to advocate for the adoption of the popular vote in presidential elections in the united states. while some may argue that the electoral college is necessary for ensuring the stability and fairness of our democracy, i believe that the popular vote is a more democratic and representative system that better reflects the will of the people. the electoral college, as it currently stands, can lead to discrepancies between the national popular vote and the electoral vote, as seen in the 2000 election. this system also has the potential to disenfranchise voters in states dominated by a single party, as their votes may not count towards the presidential election. this is not a true reflection of the democratic process. on the other hand, the popular vote would ensure that every vote counts, regardless of the state in which it was cast. this would provide a fair and equal representation of the will of the people, allowing for true democracy to be upheld. it would also encourage candidates to focus on all 50 states, rather than just swing states, which would better reflect the diverse opinions and needs of the entire country. some may argue that the electoral college ensures certainty of outcome and balances the influence of large states. however, these arguments do not negate the fact that the system is undemocratic and does not truly reflect the will of the people. additionally, the potential negative impacts of the electoral college, such as voter disenfranchisement, far outweigh any potential benefits. therefore, i urge you to support the adoption of the popular vote in presidential elections in the united states. this would be a crucial step towards a more democratic and representative democracy, which truly reflects the will and needs of all americans. thank you for your time and consideration on this important matter. sincerely, your name",0,0,4.992814565824086e-05
"the importance of physical fitness in today s world cannot be overstated. being physically active not only improves one's health and overall wellbeing, but it also has numerous additional benefits that impact our daily lives. from increasing productivity at work to improving relationships with family and friends, the effects of regular exercise are far reaching and invaluable. one major benefit of physical activity is improved mental health. exercise releases endorphins which help decrease stress levels and elevate moods, making it an ideal way to cope with anxiety or depression. additionally, exercise can improve cognitive function by enhancing memory recall capabilities as well as concentration levels thus allowing individuals to stay more focused on their tasks throughout the day. it is important for everyone to make sure they have time dedicated each week towards some type of physical activity such as running, swimming or yoga so they can reap these benefits both mentally and physically. . . exercise also aids in maintaining a healthy weight while strengthening muscles and bones simultaneously both factors which contribute greatly to overall quality of life into later years. studies suggest that those who participate in regular exercise activities tend to have better posture due to strengthened core muscles a common problem among many workers who sit for long periods at desks or in cars commuting back and forth from work everyday. furthermore, exercising helps reduce the risk for developing chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease heart attack stroke because it lowers blood pressure while raising good cholesterol levels in the body leading to increased longevity along with massive savings on healthcare costs down the line!. . . . beyond its physical advantages, participating in various types of exercise increases socialization opportunities between people from all walks of life due its communal nature when done with others either through organized sports teams or simply jogging together outside every morning before work starts activities like this bring communities closer together while promoting a sense camaraderie amongst peers which translates positively over into other aspects too!. this form team building extends far beyond just athletics though businesses often use",0,0,8.553057042099911e-05

"venus, otherwise known as the evening star , is the closest thing to earth as far as the base planets go. it is often called earth's twin, even if it doesn't seem that way. the surface temperature is nearly 800 degrees fahrenheight, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of earth. this being said, scientists are still fascinated by venus, as it could have been just like earth long ago. despite the dangers it presents, studying venus is a worthy persuit because it could lead to many scientific discoveries, and set foot on another planet and gather data, and see what happened to venus and possibly find out how to prevent it from happening to earth. even getting to venus may seem like a stretch, but keep in mind that it is at times the closest planet to us, which is important considering the long time frames of space travel. furthermore, even with the harsh surface temperatures, there's a way around it. a vehicle hovering venus would still be able to get data about the planet without burdening itself with the the tough conditions. even if this can only provide limited insight, scientists are working everyday to on technology that lasts long enough to be able to get meaningful samples such as soil, rock and gas. for example, nasa has developed simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in venus like conditions, and they lasted about 3 weeks in the harsh temperature and pressure. another project is looking to the past to mechanical computers, computers that don't use electronics, but use gears and levers to make calculations. they could be made to withstand the conditions of venus, while also taking data and making calculations for study. although there are many challenges that need to be overcame and scientific breakthroughs that need to be discovered before we even think about sending anything to venus, studying venus is a worthy persuit because of the discoveries it could hold. from regular rock and gas to preventing a catastrophe, scientists should continue to study our sister planet, and see what's really beneath the surface.",1,1,0.9880907384106147
"title the face on mars the face on mars is an interesting phenomenon that has sparked curiosity and debate among scientists and enthusiasts alike. this natural feature, which appears to resemble a human face, is found on the martian surface. theories and explanations for this unusual formation have been proposed, but what is the truth behind the face on mars? the face on mars was first observed in the late 1970s by nasa's viking orbiter. the image showed a large, distinctive rock formation that resembled a human face, complete with eyes, a nose, and a mouth. the face is situated in the cydonia region of mars's surface. several theories have been proposed to explain the origin of the face on mars. some suggest that it is the result of natural erosion processes, like weathering and erosion from wind, ice, or water. others propose that it was formed by ancient martian civilizations, who might have created the formation intentionally. however, the most widely accepted explanation for the face on mars is that it is merely the result of natural geological processes. the face like appearance can be attributed to a combination of erosion, rock formation and the way the human brain processes and recognizes shapes. the human brain has a tendency to find patterns and faces in random objects, which could be the reason behind the face like appearance of this particular rock formation. in conclusion, the face on mars is a fascinating and mysterious phenomenon that continues to intrigue people. while it's possible that the appearance is a result of ancient martian life, most scientists believe that it is simply a natural geological formation. regardless of the explanation, the face on mars remains a captivating topic for further exploration and study in the field of planetary science.",0,0,0.0060551529679691045
"limiting car usage has several notable benefits for communities and the environment. according to passage 1, reducing car trips could help alleviate traffic congestion and air pollution in cities. with fewer vehicles clogging up roads, there would be less time wasted in traffic jams. moreover, cars emitting fewer exhaust fumes means cleaner air for everyone to breathe. passage 2 supports this, finding that motor vehicles contribute significantly to air pollution levels, especially in densely populated areas. cutting back on driving would therefore leave our cities with less smog and better air quality overall. aside from reducing traffic and pollution, limiting car usage could also promote public health as stated in passage 3. getting more exercise through walking, biking or taking public transit can help citizens stay active and combat issues like obesity. regular physical activity improves cardiovascular fitness which is important for longevity and disease prevention. our communities may see health benefits as more people opt for alternative green transportation modes instead of driving everywhere. furthermore, conserving energy resources is another potential advantage highlighted in passage 1. if fewer motorists fill their gas tanks daily, there will be less demand placed on limited oil reserves. this preserves nonrenewable fossil fuels for future generations. it lessens our dependency on foreign oil as well which strengthens national energy security. saving fuel also cuts down environmental costs associated with gas production, refining and transportation. in conclusion, curbing excessive car dependence offers a variety of benefits for urban environments, public wellbeing and resource sustainability. oy, choosing alternatives to driving when possible, residents can help reduce traffic, air pollution and energy usage in a community while also increasing physical activity levels. overall, implementing strategies to limit car usage seem to have many practical advantages that cities should consider for building a healthier and more sustainable future.",0,0,0.0006987799404946191

"studying venus ws a worthy pursuit despite was dangers the author makes a compelling case that studying venus is worthwhile even given the planet's extreme conditions. while venus presents clearly hazardous dangers, the potential scientific rewards of exploration outweigh these risks. several key points from the article support this claim. first, venus shares many similarities to earth as a terrestrial planet, allowing valuable comparisons that could further our understanding of planetary evolution and climate science. venus likely had oceans in its past as well, and determining what caused its runaway greenhouse effect may offer lessons for our own planet. additionally, direct study of venus's atmosphere could yield fresh insights into chemical processes involving sulfur and carbon dioxide. with orbital images unable to fully solve these mysteries, landing probes provides an unmatched opportunity to collect in situ measurements and samples. while temperatures on venus reach over 450 degrees celsius and its atmosphere consists primarily of carbon dioxide, the author argues technological advances have made protective landers and rovers more feasible. previous soviet missions also proved exploration was possible with hardier materials. the scientific knowledge gained from even brief surface missions would represent huge strides in comprehending venus and terrestrial planet formation overall. the potential rewards easily outweigh the engineering challenges. wn sum, the author makes a convincing case that pursuing exploration of venus, despite its perilous conditions, remains a worthy scientific goal. direct study of venus offers answers to profound questions that could have implications for understanding climate change on earth. with care in mission design, the risks are manageable compared to the discoveries possible. the article provides strong evidence that venus remains a prime target for furthering knowledge about our solar system and neighboring planets like our own.",0,0,0.00560341045014302

"dear state senator, i am writing to express my opinion on the controversial topic of the electoral college. as a 9th grade student, i have been studying the pros and cons of this system and i believe that it is time for a change. the electoral college has faced criticism for its potential to cause confusion and for not always reflecting the popular vote. in the 2000 election, we saw a prime example of this when the candidate who won the popular vote did not win the presidency. this system, which was originally designed to protect state interests and federalism, is no longer relevant today. proponents of the electoral college argue that it protects the interests of smaller states, but this argument is increasingly seen as inadequate. in today's society, we have access to so much information and technology that it is no longer necessary to rely on electors to make decisions for us. direct elections would be a more equitable and straightforward method, reflecting the popular will more accurately. moreover, the origins of the electoral college are tied to concessions to slaveholders and assumptions about public information access that are no longer relevant today. it is time for us to move away from this outdated system and towards a method that better represents the people's voices. i would like to address the concern that direct elections could lead to recounts and third party candidates. while these are valid concerns, i believe that they can be addressed through implementable solutions. for instance, recounts can be avoided by implementing a more efficient and secure voting system and third party candidates can be given more opportunities to participate in the electoral process. in conclusion, i strongly believe that it is time for a change in our electoral system. the electoral college is an outdated system that no longer serves its original purpose. direct elections would be a more equitable and straightforward method, reflecting the popular will more accurately. i urge you to consider the benefits of direct elections and to take action towards implementing this change. thank you for your time and consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,1.703937661278616e-05

"title the facial action coding system decoding human emotions introduction the facial action coding system, often abbreviated as facs, is a comprehensive system that categorizes and classifies the movements of facial muscles into distinct units. developed over several decades by dr. paul ekman, a renowned psychologist and researcher in the field of emotions, this system provides a standard language for understanding and analyzing facial expressions. it plays a crucial role in various fields, ranging from psychology and sociology to computer science and animation. body 1. understanding human emotions facs helps us understand human emotions by breaking down complex facial expressions into their basic components, allowing researchers to analyze and interpret these expressions more accurately. by studying the musculature behind these expressions, we can better comprehend the nuances and variations in emotions that we experience daily. 2. communication and social interactions by identifying the specific facial movements associated with different emotions, facs helps individuals communicate more effectively. for example, when we smile, the muscles involved in raising the corners of our mouth and crinkling our eyes are classified under facs. this knowledge can help us better understand how our facial expressions can convey our emotions, intentions, or even deceive others. 3. psychotherapy and emotion based treatments facs can be utilized in psychotherapy to help therapists understand their clients' emotional states more accurately. by analyzing the clients' facial expressions, therapists can gain insight into their emotions, which can be used to develop personalized treatment plans. additionally, emotion based treatments such as laughter therapy or anger management rely on understanding facial expressions and their associated emotions for effective intervention. 4. computer science and animation the facs system is essential in the field of computer graphics and animation. it allows animators to create realistic facial animations for characters in movies, video games, or virtual reality. by studying facial expressions and their associated muscle movements, animators can create believable and lifelike characters, making the audience more invested in the story. additionally, facs can be used in creating facial recognition and analysis software, which has applications in security, access control, and even social media. conclusion in conclusion, the facial action coding system is a groundbreaking tool for understanding, communicating, interpreting, and analyzing human emotions. by categorizing and classifying the movements of facial muscles, it provides researchers, psychologists, therapists, and animators with a standard language for understanding and representing the complex nature of human emotions.",0,0,0.00021469551060090465
"the debate on driverless cars an argumentative essay driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, have been a hot topic recently. while proponents of this emerging technology believe that self driving cars are the future of transportation, skeptics argue that there are numerous challenges that must be overcome before this becomes a reality. this essay will present both sides of the argument, examining the potential benefits and limitations of driverless vehicles. those in favor of autonomous vehicles argue that this technology can significantly improve the safety of our roads. by removing the element of human error from driving, accidents caused by distractions and fatigue may be avoided. driverless cars also have the potential to increase mobility for those who are unable to drive, such as the elderly or disabled. however, opponents of this technology point out that current driverless cars still lack the ability to handle complex driving scenarios, making it necessary for humans to remain vigilant behind the wheel. this raises the question of the practicality of these vehicles if drivers are still needed, are they truly driverless? furthermore, the economic implications of driverless cars are significant. upgrading infrastructure to support autonomous vehicles may be too costly and impractical, especially when it is unclear who would bear these costs. privacy concerns may also arise from the use of autonomous vehicles. manufacturers are considering the installation of interior cameras that can monitor drivers, raising concerns about being constantly under surveillance. this level of intrusion may lead to increased stress and distracted driving, ultimately defeating the purpose of these vehicles. in conclusion, while driverless cars may seem like an exciting advancement in technology, there are numerous challenges that must be overcome before this becomes a reality. it is crucial that we focus on addressing these concerns, including practical and economic limitations, as well as privacy concerns, to ensure that any future technology truly aligns with our needs and values. until these challenges can be resolved, driverless cars remain a questionable leap rather than a necessary step forward in automotive technology.",0,0,6.565659858051387e-05

"dear principal the police i think is correct is policy 1. i think police one is correct because not only the students sometimes need to call their parents to come to pick then up or pick up early or come bring their lunch, but also because is impossible to make everyone obey policy number 2, even if is a school policy most people will ignore it, so i think policy number 1 is harder to be ignored. and even if we have a policy against cell phones students would ignore it if is at lunch time because nobody is there to tell them not to use it, and the school already have to much to pay so the school would not pay someone to look at those students who are using cell phones during lunch. i think sometimes phones are problem while using during class, but if is in lunch or free time i don't see much problem, because you are not being rude, or interrupting anyone. so i think that sometimes phones are useful at school. if we put policy number 2 at school it wouldn't make any bad things but students would still not following it, and lots of students would have their phone taken away or get in trouble because of their phones uses at school during lunch time or free time. so i think that school are a problem while using it in class but i think that is not bad to use it during lunch time or free time.",1,1,0.9999808767613096

"seeking multiple opinions when asking for advice is beneficial because it allows you to gain different perspectives on your situation or problem. each person you talk to likely has had different experiences than you and sees the world from their unique viewpoint. by hearing what more than one person has to say, you can get a well rounded understanding of your options rather than just one narrow view. for example, let's say you're debating whether to accept a new jon offer or stay in your current role. if you only spoke to one friend, they may n biased based on their own career path and push you towards the choice they personally made. however, if you talked to several trusted colleagues and friends, you'd get input from people at different stages in their careers. somebody early in their career may encourage the new opportunity for more experience, while someone more senior may advise staying put for stability. considering opinions from multiple vantage points ensures you don't miss important factors in your decision from only seeing it one way. furthermore, different people are likely to point out aspects of each choice that you may not have thought of on your own. even those close to you don't have access to your exact thoughts and likely missed key details. the more perspectives you hear, the more complete a picture you'll develop of not options. someone could note a downside that had not occurred to you or draw a link between your situation and experiences of theirs that proved instructive. the accumulation of unique insights and feedback from varied advisers helps guarantee you make the choice fully aware of not hits pros and cons. in conclusion, seeking counsel from multiple trusted individuals provides a well rounded perspective that allows for a more informed decision. you gain different viewpoints, uncover factors you may have overlooked alone and end up with a clearer picture of your options to choose the nest path forward. while any one person's advice could n biased or incomplete, considering input from several sources helps ensure you make the choice you'll feel most confident about in the long run.",0,0,0.031097981518419842
"it can be difficult to remain true to oneself in a world where there are constant forces trying to make you something else. social media, magazines, television, and other modern forms of communication reinforce ideas about who we should be, telling us one thing yet pressuring us to act another way. it can be easy to fall into the trap of believing that we must fit these outside expectations in order to be accepted. however, it is important to know that no one should have to change who they are to please someone else. being yourself is essential for good mental health. it means having the courage to stand up for what you believe in and to be yourself even when it's hard. there is great benefit in building self confidence and standing up for ourselves, and it can come with overcoming the difficulties of being ourselves in a world that is constantly trying to change us. there are many ways to achieve the important goal of remaining true to oneself. one of the best things a person can do is to surround themselves with supportive people who will accept them for who they are. an individual should also be mindful of the thoughts they have and how they perceive others. being kind and respectful of different backgrounds and beliefs can help a person feel connected to others. most importantly, it is essential to be mindful of one's thought process so they can focus on self love and acceptance instead of internalizing any unwanted pressures from society. by maintaining an attitude of self love and acceptance, one can develop the strength to be themselves even in the face of other people's opinions. ultimately, it is important to recognize the value of being yourself and the benefits it will bring. there is great strength and courage in being true to oneself and overcoming the pressures of society.",0,0,0.00035881278810728404

"venus is the second planet from the sun and the sixth largest in our solar system. its name comes from the roman goddess of love and beauty. it is often referred to as earth's sister planet due to their similar size and mass. one of the main features of venus is its dense atmosphere, made mostly of carbon dioxide, which causes its surface to experience extreme temperatures. in fact, the temperature on venus is hot enough to melt lead, reaching up to 864 f 462 c . this is because the planet's dense atmosphere traps heat, leading to a greenhouse effect. this phenomenon also causes a thick cloud cover that obscures the planet's surface from view, making it difficult for scientists to observe the surface directly. venus is sometimes called a twin to earth due to their similar size, but they have many differences as well. one of the biggest differences is that venus has a slow rotational speed, which causes it to spin very slowly on its axis. this means that a day on venus lasts longer than a year, with one venusian day being 243 earth days long. additionally, venus rotates in the opposite direction compared to the rotation of most other planets in our solar system. the surface of venus is also quite unique, as it is completely covered with solidified lava. this is due to a history of volcanic activity on the planet, which led to a complete resurfacing over time. the lack of tectonic plates and the absence of any significant water cycle on venus make it quite different from earth in terms of geologic processes. despite its extreme conditions, some scientists believe that there might be signs of past or present life on venus. this theory is supported by the detection of phosphine, a gas that can be produced by some forms of life, in the planet's atmosphere. however, further research and observations are necessary before any definite conclusions can be drawn. in conclusion, venus is a fascinating planet with many unique features and characteristics. its extreme temperatures, slow rotational speed, and potential for life make it a captivating subject of scientific study and exploration. as we continue to explore our solar system, venus remains a planet of intrigue and wonder.",0,0,0.03799971407188295

"i think social media has a big impact on society norms and values. like, for example, the way people interact with each other has changed so much since social media came around. before, people used to hang out in person and talk face to face, but now they just sit on their phones and interact through screens. this makes people less social and more antisocial. another thing is that social media makes people feel bad about themselves. like, they see all these pictures of people who look perfect and they're like, oh, i wish i looked like that. and then they go and buy all these products to try and look like that, but it's all just a scam. it's really bad for people's self esteem. also, social media makes people think that it's okay to be mean and rude to each other. like, they'll say things online that they would never say in person. this makes people feel like they can just say whatever they want and not get in trouble for it, but it's not okay. we should be treating each other with respect and kindness, both online and offline. furthermore, social media can also have a positive impact on society. like, it can connect people from all over the world and help them communicate and share ideas. it can also help people learn new things and stay informed about what's going on in the world. in conclusion, social media does have a significant impact on societal norms and values. it can make people less social, make them feel bad about themselves, and make them think it's okay to be mean and rude to each other. but it can also have positive effects, like connecting people and helping them learn new things. we need to be aware of these impacts and use social media in a way that is positive and healthy for society.",0,0,6.816631250103561e-05

"there is no single answer to the question of whether the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. some factors to consider include the cost of the tour, the size of the group, the age of the travelers, and the destination. one advantage of traveling in a group led by a tour guide is that the guide can provide a wealth of information about the destination. a good guide will have extensive knowledge about the history, culture, and geography of the area, and can share this information with the group. this can make the trip more interesting and informative. another advantage of group travel is that it can be cheaper than traveling on your own. when you book a tour, the cost of transportation, lodging, and some meals are often included in the price. this can be a cost effective way to travel, especially if you are on a budget. however, there are some disadvantages to traveling in a group. one is that the pace of the trip may be slower than if you were traveling on your own. this can be frustrating if you are eager to see as much of the destination as possible. another disadvantage is that you may not have as much flexibility as you would if you were traveling on your own. for example, you may be limited in the amount of time you can spend in each location, or you may be required to stick to a rigid itinerary. in conclusion, there is no single answer to the question of whether the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. it depends on individual factors such as the cost of the tour, the size of the group, and the age of the travelers. however, group travel can be a fun, affordable, and informative way to travel.",0,0,0.002442185622416108
"the internet has drastically and fundamentally changed the way people learn and interact with knowledge. with just a few clicks, users today can access an unprecedented amount of information about nearly any imaginable topic. even so, there are those who argue that this new system presents many challenges to traditional modes of education and undermines the rigor associated with authentic learning experiences. this essay will discuss these aspects in greater detail by focusing on the effects of online education on students pursuing a degree in history. history is an academic subject which relies heavily upon engaging directly with source texts as well as conducting research at libraries or archives something difficult for most students to do without physical proximity to such sites. online courses have enabled more convenience when it comes to accessing primary sources, but they also present unique educational issues related to verifying the accuracy of digital materials and understanding how technological advancements might influence one s interpretation of historical events. in short, while online classes may provide easier access than ever before, they could lead some learners astray if not approached properly due diligence is applied when using digital resources. one major challenge posed by relying too much on internet based material is its tendency toward bias or inaccuracy after all, anyone can post almost anything online without being held accountable for its truthfulness or relevance unlike printed documents carefully vetted through professional publishing houses that are backed up by credible credentials such as peer reviewed journals . furthermore, even though lectures delivered via video chatrooms may help bring life into topics otherwise dulled down by books alone, they also lack face to face interaction between teacher and student which historically made debates among classmates particularly stimulating exchanges where opinions were challenged and refined over time into more informed positions rather than bluntly accepted simply because they came from someone in authority figure's mouthpiece first heard them uttered elsewhere instead either within their own minds or perhaps informed conversations found only through engaging other human beings able speak back then reason together mutually understand each other's perspectives better starting points cause relevant dialogue leads",0,0,1.5156967837368842e-05

"why should students identify their career path at the beginning of high school? there are several reasons why students should identify their career path at the beginning of high school. firstly, high school courses are designed to guide students towards their future careers. by identifying their career path early on, students can tailor their high school courses to better prepare them for their chosen field. this can lead to a more focused and effective education, as well as a greater understanding of what they need to do to achieve their goals. secondly, identifying a career path at an early age can also help students make informed decisions about their education and future prospects. for example, if a student is interested in becoming a doctor, they may choose to take biology and other science classes in high school to better prepare themselves for medical school. similarly, if a student is interested in becoming a manager, they may choose to take business and economics classes. additionally, identifying a career path at an early age can also help students develop important skills, such as responsibility and time management. by taking on responsibilities such as completing their coursework and participating in school activities, students can learn how to manage their time effectively and take ownership of their education. however, some people argue that it is not appropriate to make such big decisions at such a young age. they believe that teenagers should be given the freedom to explore different career paths and make choices based on their interests and passions. while this is a valid point, it is also important to remember that the choices made during this time can have a significant impact on a person's future prospects. in conclusion, identifying a career path at the beginning of high school can be beneficial for students in many ways. it can help them tailor their education to better prepare them for their chosen field, make informed decisions about their future prospects, and develop important skills such as responsibility and time management. while it is important to give teenagers the freedom to explore different career paths, it is also important to remember that the choices made during this time can have a significant impact on a person's future prospects.",0,0,4.206542934277384e-06

"dear teacher name, i would just like to say that i think changing the policy is a bad idea for many reasons. one reason would be because, most students play sports to get things off their minds to make the grades they are. plus taking things they enjoy away will just stress them out and make them mad of course you may still think this is a good solution but us children think differently. the people that play sports will find a way to one way or another. lest they be heard they will revolt and take action. also if many students have a c average then we would just not have very good and mighty teams you might as well take out all sports and just say we aren't going to have any sports but then if you did that i could almost ensure you that we would only have people at our school that could care less about sports which is very few. now if you changed the policy where students with a c average could play then that would be efficient and reasonable because c is passing and i think everyone could agree with if you don't have a c average then you shouldn't play. another reason why i don't agree is because we would have a lot more fights most scholars play sports to get their anger out and so that would just cause even more conflicts and then it would go to suspension and so on and so forth. i really hope you understand what i am trying to say and take my advice into deep consideration then maybe our school will be more successful. sincerely, student name",1,1,0.9999700175075265

"phones and driving is your phone or life more important? this is a frequently asked question for people that are so consumed by their phones while driving. as much as technology is a great essential to everyday life it is a huge threat to our lives especially while driving. people will always say it's fine i won't crash! then boom one reply to a text that could've been sent when you have reached somewhere safe has taken your life. i want to speak on the importance of not texting while driving or just being on your phone at all, because it can save the lives of many. i believe that people should not be able to operate a phone at all while driving a vehicle, because not only are you putting your life in danger, you're putting someone else's life in danger as well. reported by the national safety council that cell phone use while driving causes 1.6 million crashes each year. in society people will point the finger to teenagers, but what the world must understand is that everyone plays a big role in this destruction. law enforcement officials have tried to crack down on the problem of texting and driving or just occupying a phone in general. this is very hard because they're people out there that use their phones to navigate where they're going but this could also be a distraction. also, a police officer can't catch every person that they see using a phone while driving and it's not legal to just suspect and pull someone and ask them for their phone. so, in that case there is not much law enforcement officials can do. i believe that law officials should give people warnings and if a car accident is caused by someone not paying attention to the road they should be arrested, because they're putting someone else's life in danger as much as their own. driving classes that prepare you to take on the road should talk about this subject more and show the numbers of people being killed from accidents caused by phones. if we really want this problem to stop, we as people need to spread awareness on this topic! ampey 2",1,1,0.9971722106014449

"as a concerned citizen, it's important to understand the advantages of limiting car usage. with increasing pollution levels in our cities, it's time to take action to protect our environment and our health. one effective solution is to implement partial driving bans, which can significantly reduce congestion and pollution levels. paris is a great example of the benefits of limiting car usage. the city faced severe pollution, prompting a ban on odd and even numbered license plates on alternate days. this action reduced congestion by 60 percent and addressed smog levels comparable to beijing. while some motorists faced fines and impounding, the restrictions were necessary to improve air quality. one of the main contributors to smog in paris is diesel vehicles, which are prevalent due to tax policies. diesel vehicles emit harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. limiting the use of these vehicles can help reduce these emissions and improve air quality. it's not just about protecting the environment, but also our own health. smog can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and other health issues. by limiting car usage, we can reduce these risks and improve our overall well being. while some may argue that limiting car usage will hurt businesses and the economy, it's important to note that there are exceptions for eco friendly and high occupancy vehicles. this encourages the use of more sustainable transportation options and can even lead to more economic growth in the long run. in addition, public transport was made free during the ban, which not only reduced congestion but also encouraged more people to use public transportation. this not only reduced emissions, but also made transportation more accessible and affordable for everyone. overall, limiting car usage has numerous benefits for our environment and our health. it's time to take action to protect our cities and our well being. by implementing partial driving bans, promoting eco friendly transportation options, and improving public transport, we can create a cleaner and healthier future for all.",0,0,1.6587691583349062e-05

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular vote. the electoral college is an outdated and undemocratic system that gives disproportionate power to a handful of small states. in recent years, the electoral college has failed to reflect the will of the people in two of the last five presidential elections. in 2000, george w. bush won the presidency despite losing the popular vote to xl gore. xnd in 2016, donald trump won the presidency despite losing the popular vote to hillary clinton by nearly three million votes. the electoral college is also a major source of voter apathy. many people feel that their vote does not matter because they live in a state that is already considered to be a safe state for one party or the other. this is particularly true in states with many electoral votes, such as california and texas. xbolishing the electoral college would make every vote count in presidential elections. it would also ensure that the president is elected by the majority of the american people, rather than by a small group of swing voters in a handful of states. i urge you to support legislation that would abolish the electoral college and elect the president of the united states by popular vote. thank you for your time. sincerely, your game",0,0,0.0012497675238149174

"dear state senator's name , i hope this letter finds you well. as a concerned citizen of your state's name , i am writing to express my views on the electoral college system and its relevance in the presidential election process. after carefully analyzing the arguments for and against the electoral college, i have come to the conclusion that it is crucial to maintain this system in our democratic framework. one of the most significant advantages of the electoral college is the prevention of a tie in the electoral vote. as bradford plume highlights in his article for mother jones, the indefensible electoral college, a tie in the electoral vote would lead to a constitutional crisis, as the house of representatives would have to decide the president plume, 2004 . this is an undesirable outcome, as it would undermine the democratic process and potentially lead to political gridlock. the electoral college ensures that the candidate who wins the most votes nationwide is also the one who wins the presidency, preventing such an unprecedented scenario. another advantage of the electoral college is that it encourages presidential candidates to campaign across the country, rather than focusing solely on swing states. as judge richard poster argues in his article for slate magazine, in defense of the electoral college, a candidate with regional appeal has little incentive to campaign in other regions, as they would not receive any electoral votes poster, 2012 . however, under the electoral college system, a candidate must appeal to voters across the country to win the presidency, resulting in a more nationally focused campaign. this is particularly important in a diverse nation like the united states, where different regions have distinct interests and concerns",0,0,0.006361377796081551

"pure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student in response to the given prompt distance learning is a great option for students who can't attend classes in person, especially those with physical disabilities and or economic limitations. for one, it allows them to learn from the comfort of their own homes, which can be really helpful for students who have trouble getting around or who live far away from school. for instance, my friend sarah has a physical disability that makes it hard for her to walk long distances, so she would love to be able to take her classes from home. phe's really smart and works hard, but she sometimes gets tired easily and needs to take breaks. with distance learning, she could take her classes in her own pace and not have to worry about getting tired or feeling left behind. another benefit of distance learning is that it can help students who come from low income families. some families might not be able to afford the costs of transportation, uniforms, and other school supplies, so distance learning could be a more affordable option for them. plus, students could learn from home and avoid the stigma of being the only one in their class who can't afford certain things. moreover, distance learning can also provide more flexibility for students who have other commitments, like sports or extracurricular activities. they could take their classes at a time that works best for them, without having to worry about missing important events or practices. of course, there are some downsides to distance learning too. for example, students might miss out on facetoface interaction with their teachers and classmates, which can be really important for building relationships and learning social skills. and some students might struggle with staying motivated and organized without the structure of a traditional classroom. overall, though, i think distance learning is a great option for students who need it. it can provide them with more flexibility and accommodations, and help them learn in a way that works best for them. po, i think schools should definitely consider offering distance learning as an option for students with physical disabilities and or economic limitations.",0,0,0.00011499904134075787

"many people in the united states arv becoming more and more award of the advantages of limiting car usage. many don't find this important or ffvl uncomfortable adapting new customs, but it is very important to limit car usage. limiting car usage contributes to many factors in cities and can also help the environment. first, limiting car usage contributes to the way cities, towns, or suburbs arv. for example the first article carry cities shows a example of a suburb in germany where people have given up their cars. this suburb vauban, germany, has bvn a success and even 57 percent of the people living there have sold their cars in order to live there, while 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars. a media trainer, evidon walter, said when i had a car i was always tons. i', much happier this way, and it's not only her that falls this way, many other people in this suburb have vxpvrivncvd and enjoyed the nocarfvvling. also, this article states that a low car suburban life makes suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. this makes living there a lot more easier and comfortable. second, limiting car usage helps the environment. according to the first article carfrvvcitivs says that passenger cars arv responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas missions in europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintvnsivv areas in the united states and that missions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class arv choking cities. this two facts show how bad cars arv for the environment, and not only that, but also, cars polite the air horribly. for example, in the second article paris bans driving due to smog said that paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. this smog has affected a lot of cities as well and now on of the main goals people have is to promote alternative transportation due to this. to conclude, there arv many advantages of limiting car usage and not limiting is hurting the world. everyone should bv more considerate of their environment and limit their car usage.",1,1,0.9290626043400455
"during the 1700's the world did not have transportation like we do now. they had to ride on horses and walk to where they needed to go. now all we depend on is driving where we need to go. its hurting our world and the people around who are around it. their are plenty of advantages of limiting car usage around the world. many people think its no good side to not driving around everywhere but their are. stores are becoming closer to walking distance. it stops cars from poluting the world and it lessons stress from the human body. everywhere you look you see a store or a building. we drive to places because we think its to far a walk or its a bad day to walk. in the article in german suburb,life goes on without cars it says that in vauban,germany they built stores that were a good walking distance on a main street instead on a long far away highway. so that means the stores are closer to you,which is good because you can go alot more often if they are closer and easy to get to. another advantage to that is that its faster to walk if they bring the stores closer to you. this is some of the advantages to limiting car usage. cars are polluting our world everyday and everynight night somebody wants to drive. in the aritcle paris bans driving due to fog it says that paris had to force people to leave their cars at home or they would have to pay a fine if they drive it. it says that it was intense smog. cars cause alot of damage to the world but people who drive dont see how it's effecting the world. the smog caused alot of traffic to happen and that most likely caused car accidents to happen. instead of driving if you walk it helps you not worry about gas prices or anything that you worry about that is related to driving so it relieves stress. all in all limiting car driving is the way to go. it improves the walking distance to and from the stores. it helps the world from being polluted and relieves stress from your body. why would'nt you want that for yourself and your family.",1,1,0.9999697368157952

"in my opinion i truly believe that people should not be able to use or operate cell phones while driving. there is a several reasons that i think support this theory. for instance the danger actor, driving while on the phone can pull your concentration from anything and everything that you do. these distractions can easily cause an accident which is putting your life and future at risk. i personally think that the cons' oy driving and using your phone yar outweigh the pros and here why. one of the reasons that i think that driving and using the phone is unacceptable is because it causes a major distraction. diverting your attention from driving a vehicle at any time is an enamors mistake because it only takes seconds to crash. making a small text or call can easily cause you thousands in damages to your car and even another civilians' car. not to mention it can also create a complication with the insurances companies and cause a spike in your current insurance rate. another big risk and something that is common among drivers nowadays is being sued. this does not occur very often but can be one of the most troubling and biggest hits to a person's pocket. one second your looking at your phone to check and text and the next you're dealing with a lawsuit that can cause you to pay thousands upon thousand soy dollars. when in a scenario like this the opposing person can claim any kind of allegations weather they be true are not, and you must be liable to either pay up or light the case in court. what really are some pros' oy driving and texting and calling anyway? for me there's not much that i can really think of. it's clear that the cons outweigh the pros, so why even take the risk. not only is it a risk to your life buts it's also a risk to your pocket and can be hazardous to other people. in con conclusion to my research i truly believe that texting and driving or doing anything on your phone is definitely unacceptable in modern life.",1,1,0.9527608403010529

"the electoral college is a system used in the united states to elect the president and vice president. it was established under the us constitution, with the goal of balancing the power of large and small states, as well as ensuring a more decentralized approach to selecting the nation's leaders. the electoral college system works by allocating a certain number of electors to each state, based on the state's representation in congress. this means that each state is awarded a specific number of electors according to its total number of senators and representatives in the federal government. for example, texas has 38 electors, california has 55, and wyoming has 3. on election day, citizens cast their votes for their preferred candidate. the candidate who wins the popular vote in each state receives all of its electors, which are then sent to the electoral college. the members of the electoral college then meet and cast their ballots to determine the president and vice president of the united states. in the event of a candidate winning the majority of the nation's electoral votes, they become the president and vice president. however, if no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes, then the house of representatives votes for the president, and the senate votes for the vice president. the electoral college system has been a topic of discussion for many years, with both its strengths and weaknesses being highlighted by various groups. its main strength is that it allows for representation of all states, regardless of population size. however, it has also been criticized for potentially allowing the election of a candidate who does not have the support of a majority of the population, which can lead to concerns about democratic representation. overall, the electoral college system has been a part of american politics since its inception, and while it may not be perfect, it continues to function as intended, ensuring that the voices of all states are heard in the presidential election process.",0,0,0.062332713276921574
"have you ever wanted to trust a car with your life? i for sure have not. in the text, google cofounder, sergey brin was quoted saying, such cars would fundamentally change the world. i disagree, driverless cars are a terrible idea for many reasons. the economy would fall tremendously. many of people's lives would be at risk, and it's inhuman. the economy is my biggest worry when it comes to driverless cars. many jobs would be lost because of this. bus drivers, taxi drivers, and factory workers jobs would be at risk. if this were to happen many families would be left homeless and hungry. another reason is that this could be very dangerous. i don't know about you, but i don't want to put my life in the hands of a couple of cameras and sensors. people need to understand that computers make mistakes, and they are not perfect. the author even said, in fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless.'' this means that the driver would have to remain focused and pay attention the entire time. i think this would cause some major problems. the driver would be texting or even sleeping at the wheel. that is definitely not safe! my final reason is that the driverless car is inhuman. the human race has become very lazy over the last several hundred years. yes, we have made life much more safe and efficient, but driverless cars is going too far. computers and robots are already taking our people's jobs in the factories, do we really want the to take hold of our cars? to conclude, i don't agree with this article. i believe that driverless cars would cause many problems around the world. the economy would suffer, our safety would be at risk, and the idea of driverless cars is inhuman.",1,1,0.9908451223575382
"venus, our closest neighboring planet, is a fascinating and unique world in its own right. it is the second planet from the sun, and has been a subject of scientific inquiry for centuries. in the last few decades, advances in technology have allowed us to explore venus more deeply than ever before. venus has a thick, dense atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide. it is also incredibly hot, reaching temperatures of 864 degrees fahrenheit 462 degrees celsius . due to these extreme conditions, scientists believe venus might once have been a habitable planet with water and life. one of the primary reasons for studying venus is to better understand the evolution of our own planet earth. scientists believe that early in its history, earth and venus may have shared similarities, with earth eventually evolving into a habitable environment. studying venus can help us understand how earth's environment changed over time, and possibly shed light on how life evolved on our own planet. in the 1960s, nasa conducted a series of missions to venus, including mariner 2, which was the first spacecraft to successfully fly by another planet. later, missions like the soviet union's venera probes and nasa's pioneer venus orbiter provided valuable information about the planet. more recently, nasa's messenger mission mercury surface, space environment, geochemistry, and ranging conducted a flyby of venus on its way to mercury. the flyby collected valuable data on venus' atmosphere and magnetic field. in addition to these missions, astronomers are also studying venus through telescopes on earth and in space. they use these tools to observe the planet's surface, weather patterns, and atmospheric dynamics. while venus may seem like an unfavorable place to live or even visit, it still holds many scientific mysteries that are waiting to be solved. by studying this fascinating planet, we not only gain knowledge of our own planet's history but also deepen our understanding of our solar system as a whole.",0,0,0.026166863314934494
"opening in the article the challenge of exploring venus, the author argues that, despite the risks involved, exploring venus is a crucial endeavor for space exploration. while the author acknowledges the dangers of venus's harsh environment, they believe the potential benefits of exploration outweigh the risks. in this essay, i will evaluate how effectively the author substantiates this viewpoint and whether or not i agree with their argument. main section the author provides several points to support their argument for venus exploration. they highlight the geological similarities between venus and earth and how understanding venus's evolution could provide insights into earth's future. additionally, they point out the relative accessibility of venus compared to other planets in our solar system. however, i believe the author could have made a more compelling argument by providing specific examples of the potential benefits of venus exploration. while the author acknowledges the challenges of exploring venus, they also note recent technological advancements that could make exploration more feasible. for example, they mention the concept of floating research stations that could circumvent the hostile surface environment. however, i think the article could have provided more detailed information about these advancements and how they could mitigate the risks involved in venus exploration. furthermore, the author notes that venus's dense atmosphere impedes data collection and that orbiting or hovering missions come with limitations. i agree with this point, and it highlights the significant technological hurdles that need to be overcome before we can safely explore venus. closing in conclusion, while the author makes some compelling arguments for venus exploration, i believe they could have done a better job of supporting their viewpoint with specific examples and evidence. while venus exploration holds significant potential, the risks involved require careful consideration and planning. as technology continues to advance, we may one day be able to safely explore this enigmatic planet, but for now, caution is warranted.",0,0,0.00018481072314627424

"standardized testing is a topic that has been debated upon for many years. these exams are used to measure a student's ability in various subjects, and the results are used to determine their academic progress. as a student, i believe that standardized tests are not an accurate measure of a student's ability. in this essay, i will provide specific reasons and examples to support my argument. firstly, standardized tests do not take into account a student's learning style or their individual capabilities. every student is unique and learns at their own pace, but standardized tests treat every student the same. for instance, some students may excel in multiple choice questions, while others may struggle with them. this means that a student's performance on a standardized test may not necessarily reflect their actual knowledge or skills in a particular subject. secondly, standardized testing creates a high pressure environment for students. these exams are often timed, and students are expected to perform well within a specific time frame. this can be overwhelming for some students, and it may not allow them to showcase their true abilities. additionally, the results of these exams can have a significant impact on a student's future, such as their admission into college or their job prospects. this pressure can often lead to high levels of stress and anxiety, which can negatively impact a student's performance. lastly, standardized tests do not consider other factors that may affect a student's performance, such as their socio economic background or their mental health. for example, a student who comes from a low income family may not have access to the same resources as a student from a wealthy family, which can impact their academic performance. similarly, a student who struggles with mental health issues may find it challenging to focus during exams, which can also affect their performance. in conclusion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of a student's ability. they do not take into account a student's learning style, their individual capabilities, or other factors that may affect their performance. as a result, i believe that schools should consider alternative forms of assessment that are more personalized and reflective of a student's actual knowledge and skills.",0,0,3.644814084109096e-06

"in my opinion i think we should change voting to popular vote. the reason why is because the government sometimes performs certain actions that they think is good for the people when at the end of it it's really not it's just for the government to get more money. so when it comes to the president of the united states of america i think we should change it to popular vote. because the electoral college might mess up divisions and it's a really lad thing to mess up the decision of who is the president of our country. in the past we have had many lad presidents lacause of mess ups in electoral colleges or uneven amounts of electoral voters. also, bradford plume states that in last election 60 of voters preferred a direct election and not an electoral college vote. also, votes would le settled much easier because there would a one in a million chance of getting votes tied, and the people would have it there way. if we were to keep the electoral college there will continue to have untrustworthy presidents or responsible presidents like obama, george lush jr, or ronald reagan. the downside to having popular vote would le that if a candidate were to convince the american people to follow his commands like adolf hitler did and lead them blindly then that would le a major problem. but the constitution has rights and amendments that doesn't allow for those types of incidents to occur. therefore, those are my reasons for wanting to change the system of electoral voting to le changed to popular voting.",1,1,0.9972837259544471

"the facial action coding system facs is a method of categorizing and identifying human facial expressions based on the underlying muscle movements. developed by dr. paul ekman in the 1970s, facs consists of a comprehensive set of facial muscle movements that correspond to different emotions or expressions. this system helps in the understanding and analysis of emotional states and facial expressions by providing a standardized language for communication among researchers and professionals in various fields such as psychology, psychiatry, and law enforcement. the facs system categorizes facial expressions into specific action units, which are the smallest components of facial expressions. these action units can further be combined to form more complex and recognizable emotions. for instance, a raised eyebrow can be an action unit that represents surprise or curiosity. when paired with other facial muscle movements, such as an arching of the upper lip and a wrinkled forehead collectively called a frown , it forms the facial expression known as surprise. the facs has been extensively researched, and its accuracy in identifying emotions and expressions has been widely acknowledged. it has also been utilized in various applications, such as detecting lies or deception in law enforcement, analyzing emotional states during psychotherapy sessions, and improving social interactions for individuals with autism spectrum disorder asd . in summary, the facial action coding system facs is a vital methodology in the study of human facial expressions and emotions. by categorizing and standardizing facial muscle movements into action units, it allows researchers and professionals in various fields to communicate effectively, analyze emotional states, and potentially improve interpersonal relationships and understanding between individuals.",0,0,8.451982287440582e-05

"the three year high school program has been gaining popularity in recent years, and it's important to analyze the effects it has on students' education and future planning. while some argue that this program provides students with more opportunities to take elective courses and prepare for college, others argue that it can lead to rushing final year courses and a lack of depth in learning. in this essay, i will present a persuasive argument on whether or not students should be given the opportunity to graduate high school in three years. firstly, the three year high school program allows students to take a wider range of elective courses. by taking more electives, students can explore their interests and talents, and potentially discover new areas of study that they may not have considered before. this can lead to a more well rounded education, as students are exposed to different subjects and perspectives. additionally, taking more electives can help students stand out to colleges and employers, as it shows that they are proactive and self motivated in their learning. however, the drawback of the three year high school program is that it can lead to rushing final year courses. with only three years to complete high school, students may feel pressure to complete their required courses as quickly as possible, which can lead to a lack of depth in learning. this can be particularly problematic in subjects like math and science, where a strong foundation is essential for success in college and beyond. additionally, rushing through final year courses can lead to a lack of critical thinking and problem solving skills, which are important for success in any field. in conclusion, while the three year high school program provides students with more opportunities to take elective courses, it can also lead to rushing final year courses and a lack of depth in learning. as such, it's important for schools and policymakers to carefully consider the benefits and drawbacks of this program before implementing it. ultimately, students should be given the opportunity to graduate high school in three years if they choose to do so, but it should be accompanied by adequate support and resources to ensure that they are able to succeed academically and personally.",0,0,4.314027324992765e-05

"important in today's world. having a positive attitude is a crucial aspect of our lives, both in the workplace and in daily life. it is a mindset that allows us to approach challenges with optimism, resilience, and determination. in this essay, i will explore the benefits of having a positive attitude, the role of respect in maintaining a positive attitude, and how it affects our lives compared to a negative attitude. first, let's examine the benefits of having a positive attitude in the workplace. research has shown that employees with a positive attitude are more productive, creative, and engaged in their work. they are also more likely to have better relationships with their colleagues and superiors, leading to a more collaborative and supportive work environment. moreover, a positive attitude can help employees cope with stress and adversity, leading to a more balanced and fulfilling life both inside and outside of work. in daily life, having a positive attitude can have a significant impact on our overall wellbeing. it can help us navigate through difficult situations with grace and resilience, leading to a more positive outlook on life. it also helps us attract positive energy and opportunities into our lives, leading to a more fulfilling and happy existence. furthermore, a positive attitude can help us overcome negative self talk and self doubt, leading to a more confident and self assured personality. the role of respect is also crucial in maintaining a positive attitude. respect is the foundation of any healthy relationship, and it is no different in the workplace or in daily life. when we respect others, we create a sense of mutual trust and understanding, leading to a more harmonious and productive environment. respect also helps us develop empathy and compassion towards others, leading to a more compassionate and understanding society. comparing and contrasting how a positive attitude affects our lives compared to a negative attitude, we can see the stark difference it makes. a negative attitude can lead to feelings of hopelessness, despair, and lack of motivation, leading to a more unfulfilling and unhappy existence. on the other hand, a positive attitude can lead to feelings of optimism, resilience, and determination, leading to a more fulfilling and happy existence. in conclusion, having a positive attitude is crucial in today's world. it can have a significant impact on our lives both in the workplace and in",0,0,6.15316125314298e-07
"the development of technology has revolutionized our world in countless ways. from communication to entertainment, it seems like virtually every aspect of our lives has been impacted by the digital age. however, one area that often goes overlooked is its effect on education. technology has had a drastic and significant impact on how students learn in the classroom today versus even just a few years ago. one way in which technology has changed learning is through increased access to information available online and other digital sources. with internet connected devices such as laptops and tablets becoming increasingly ubiquitous, students have more resources than ever before at their fingertips for gathering knowledge outside of the traditional textbook format. this includes websites dedicated to academic topics, interactive videos demonstrating concepts or theories from various disciplines, and an overwhelming abundance of relevant documents stored away in databases around the globe. the sheer amount of data accessible makes research much easier than before and allows students to explore issues with greater depth than ever before possible within school walls. technology also enables new methods for engaging learners through experimentation as well as collaboration with peers both locally and worldwide via social media platforms or video conferencing software such as skype or google hangouts. by allowing them to visualize different topics being discussed in class they can make connections between ideas faster while also having fun at the same time rather than simply reading what s written on paper alone. additionally, teachers are able to utilize multiple forms of assessment tools beyond simple tests or projects this could range from virtual simulations that demonstrate scientific principles through gaming experiences all the way up to robotics competitions where teams must create solutions using programming languages they learned earlier on throughout their coursework allowing real world applications far beyond what would be achievable without computers present within educational environments . . finally, technology offers unique opportunities for personalized instruction tailored specifically towards individual student needs instead of relying solely upon standardized teaching techniques across all classes taught regardless who's attending them which was previously necessary due lack adequate resources . by utilizing adaptive learning systems based",0,0,0.00026711340078225783

"dear state senator, i would like for you to change it to popular vote because ... under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president. if you lived in texas for example and you wanted to vote for john kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 344 democratic electors pledged to kerry . on the off chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 electoral votes. who are the electors? they can be anyone not holding public office. who picks the electors? they can be anyone not holding public office. who picks the electors in the first place ? it depends on the state, sometimes state conventions, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. can voters control who their electors vote for? not always. do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? sometimes. also, the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. most worrying thing is that of a tie in the electoral vote. in that case, the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote of the president. at the most basic level, the electoral college is just unfair to the voters. because of the winner take all systemin each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. therefore, you should change it to popular vote, not electoral college.",1,1,0.995110611320833
"i believe that the use of driverless cars is a decent idea, although it does have its downsides. the idea of drivers and passengers not having to drive themselves would provide a luxury feel to most participants in the driverless car movement. this could also help with very common safety issues texting while driving, intoxicated while driving, or must flat out not paying attention. in paragraph 10, we see that not only is the driverless car and idea, it's happening. if these manufacturers are still running on track, then we should start to see the sprout of driverless cars this year. this implies that people need to start thinking and making decisions on whether they want to sit back and let a computer do the work or not. while i can see the problem of boredom, stated in paragraph 8, i think that this would empower the driver more. he she would be able to kick and enjoy the ride without paying 100 percent of their undivided attention to the road. long trips and vacations would be made much easier with this, or even for truck drivers who drive late at night. the united states has been exposed to a large amount of deaths from texting while driving, this could be the end of that. while they would still need to pay slight attention to the warning signals given that they need to grab the wheel, if the driver picked up his her phone while a computer drove them around, it wouldn't be too bad. another issue imposed on drivers is being intoxicated and driving. this would also be solved with a driverless car. the driver wouldn't pose a danger to themselves or the passengers in the vehicle if being almost chauffeured around. this however could still be an issue if the car needed the driver to take control. i believe that a driverless car would most definitely benefit drivers everywhere. it could solve many issues that stand due to full attention driving and would cut the death rate from car accidents by a large chunk.",1,1,0.9963807037342164

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular vote. the electoral college is a system that was created in the 18th century and is no longer relevant in the 21st century. the founding fathers created the electoral college in order to protect the interests of small states. they feared that if the president were elected by popular vote, only the large states would have any influence on the election. however, this is no longer the case. today, small states have just as much of a voice in the electoral college as large states. in fact, some small states have more power in the electoral college than they do in the house of representatives or the senate. the electoral college is also a system that is easily manipulated. in the 2000 election, al gore won the popular vote but lost the election because he lost the electoral college vote. this was due to the fact that george w. bush won the popular vote in florida, even though gore won the popular vote in the country as a whole. this is just one example of how the electoral college can lead to an unfair election. i believe that the president of the united states should be elected by the people. the people are the ones who will be affected by the president's policies, so they should be the ones who have the final say in who becomes president. i urge you to support a constitutional amendment that would abolish the electoral college and elect the president by popular vote. thank you for your time and consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.014500815694014063
"i believe that students should have the freedom to choose their own electives rather than being forced to take a class in the arts. while it is important for students to have exposure to the arts, assigning them to a class they know nothing about sets them up for failure. this is especially true in the school district, where it is important to have something to look forward to when students arrive at school. it is important to give students the opportunity to decide what they believe in and have no doubt about it. by allowing students to choose their own electives, they will be more motivated and engaged in their learning. this will ultimately lead to better grades and a more positive attitude towards school. furthermore, if students are not interested in the class they are assigned to, they may not attend. this not only affects their learning but also the overall success of the class. by encouraging students to choose the right fit class, we can ensure that they are engaged and motivated to learn. in conclusion, giving students the opportunity to choose their own electives will increase their satisfaction rate and expand on more ideas for the school in the future. by allowing students to make decisions that could impact their future goals, we can help them become positive and successful individuals.",0,0,0.001546109978985513
"although limiting car usage may seem out of the ordinary, it has many benefits that appeal to people. by limiting car usage, people save money, the air isn't being poluted as much and there aren't as many traffic jams. for starters, not having or using a vehicle is a huge money saver. for example, a german suburb, freiburg, near french and swiss borders allow the use of cars, but is somewhat strict. rosenthal states, car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park large garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home. not only does it cost 40,000 just for that but gas and fix ups go along with having a car. secondly, the less people use vehicles, the less air pollution is going to be created. for instance, paris issued a driving ban in an effort to clear the air of the global city. duffer says, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after five days of intensifying smog... the smog that affects paris is also known to rival with bejing, china, one of the most polluted cities in the world. by banning car usage for a day, the air had a chance to breathe and is overall healthier for the people that live in that area. lastly, it's obvious to say that with less car usage, the more likely it is to have a decrease in number of traffic jams. to further explain, bogota, columbia has a program in which people do not use vehicles to get where they need to go. andrew selsky states, ...millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car free day.. leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. it's a positive thing to have car free day because less accidents mean less people getting injured. to conclude, limiting car usage is not only good for people, but it can be positive toward the earth and environment as well because it saves people money, the air is healthier and people have less of a chance of crashing.",1,1,0.9718712578542295
some people say working alone is more benifical. well i think working in a group is more benifical. my first reason is it keeps you away from boredom. it keeps you away from starring at a wall for hours. and it keeps you away from sleeping in a class room. its more helpful having someone to raise and boost your energy and being the confident person you are. now days in a classroom were haveing 60 percentr on students being unsure about there answers and being unsure if they should even speak up. being in a group helps you raise your voice. manny adult and students are suffering boredom and thats not healthy. talking to your peers and being around people more keeps you away from depression. making your self feel more confident about yourself shows who you really are its like the next step to being a risk taker. my second reason is you can talk and discuss with your group about your project or work together. its more faster being in a group where you can actually discuss about your thoughts and idea and feeling more confident than ever. having a partner check it look togerther for any mistake or errors. my final reason is you save lots of time for yourself. and not everyone is right. but creating these ideas from yourself and your group could make something turn out to be unthinkable. being in a group makes your mind grow and learn new things and ideas from other people. your having a good time with your friends and if not you meet new people that may become friends with you. you want to talk and move around and meet new people getting out. not being shy or denying yourself wrong. being in a group is like your bring peace in a table. i belive that everyone should try new things being in a groups and its okay if your wrong because there is no right answer. being in a group helps you become bigger and bold about yourself your trusting you self and your classmate. i believe working in a group is more benificaial rather than working along cecking your self and thinking if your rong and feeling unpositive about yourself.,1,1,0.9923096335694641

"the facial action coding system facs is an important tool in the field of facial expression analysis and understanding. developed by dr. paul ekman and dr. wallace friesen, facs is a standardized method of identifying and categorizing the movements of facial muscles that produce distinct emotions and facial expressions. the system consists of 43 facial action units aus . each au represents a specific muscle movement, which contributes to a specific facial expression. these aus can be combined in various ways to create more complex facial expressions. facs has several applications in various fields. one of the most well known is in the field of psychology, where it is used to study emotions and nonverbal communication. facs has been instrumental in helping researchers understand how people communicate through facial expressions, and how these expressions can vary across different cultures. in addition, facs has found applications in the fields of acting, animation, and law enforcement. actors can use facs to better portray emotions in a natural and authentic manner, while animators can use it to create realistic facial expressions for their characters. in law enforcement, facs has been used to analyze the emotional content of witness testimonies or suspect interrogations, which may help in identifying deception. in conclusion, the facial action coding system is an essential tool for the analysis and understanding of human facial expressions. it has been widely applied across various fields, from psychology to law enforcement, and has greatly enhanced our knowledge of nonverbal communication, emotional expressions, and the study of facial muscle movements.",0,0,3.406439701418076e-05

"car usage has been a significant part of our daily lives for decades, but recent studies suggest that we may be experiencing a shift in our behavior towards more sustainable forms of transportation. xhe passage set highlights several examples of communities that have successfully implemented measures to limit car usage, including vauban, germany, and paris, france. one of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and the united states, and by reducing the number of cars on the road, we can make a significant impact on our carbon footprint. additionally, reducing car usage can lead to improved air quality and reduced traffic congestion. another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative forms of transportation, such as public transit, cycling, and walking. by providing more options for people to get around, we can encourage people to choose more sustainable and active forms of transportation. xhis can lead to improved health outcomes and a more active lifestyle. however, there are some potential counterclaims to limiting car usage. for example, some people may argue that limiting car usage would negatively impact the economy, as many jobs are tied to the automotive industry. additionally, some people may argue that limiting car usage would be inconvenient and restrict their freedom to travel. despite these potential counterclaims, the evidence from the passage set suggests that limiting car usage can have significant benefits. for example, in vauban, germany, 70 of families do not own cars, and 57 sold a car to move there. additionally, in paris, france, the city enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of smog, resulting in a 60 reduction in congestion. overall, while there may be some potential drawbacks to limiting car usage, the evidence suggests that the benefits far outweigh the costs. by reducing our reliance on cars, we can make a significant impact on our carbon footprint, promote alternative forms of transportation, and improve our health and wellbeing.",0,0,1.8092516079863318e-06
"as an 8th grader, i strongly believe that students should be required to take a class in the arts or other electives. while some may argue that requiring students to take electives can be detrimental to their academic performance, i believe that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. firstly, taking a class in the arts can have a profound impact on a student's academic performance. studies have shown that students who participate in the arts tend to perform better in other subjects, such as math and reading. this is because the arts help to develop critical thinking skills, creativity, and problem solving abilities, which are essential for success in all areas of academia. additionally, taking a class in the arts can help students to develop their self expression and communication skills, which are crucial for success in any field. however, some may argue that requiring students to take electives can lead to a lack of focus on core subjects, such as math and science. while it is true that electives may take away from the time and attention dedicated to these subjects, i believe that this is a small price to pay for the benefits that electives provide. ny taking a class in the arts or other electives, students can gain a well rounded education that prepares them for the real world. another argument against requiring students to take electives is that some students may not take the subject seriously. while it is true that some students may not be interested in the arts or other electives, i believe that this can be overcome by providing students with a variety of elective options that cater to their interests and abilities. ny giving students the freedom to choose their own electives, they are more likely to take the subject seriously and enjoy the learning process. in conclusion, requiring students to take a class in the arts or other electives can have numerous benefits for their academic performance and overall well rounding. while there may be some drawbacks to requiring students to take electives, i believe that the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. ny providing students with a variety of elective options, we can give them the tools they need to succeed in the real world and become well rounded individuals.",0,0,9.835891340798902e-06
"successful people often have a reputation for taking risks and trying new things. this is because taking risks and trying new things can lead to greater success. i agree that successful people should take risks and try new things rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. taking risks and trying new things can lead to greater success because it allows people to expand their knowledge and skills. for example, if someone is a successful accountant, they may decide to take a course in coding to expand their skillet and open up new career opportunities. by taking this risk, they may find that they enjoy coding and can use it to take their career to the next level. taking risks and trying new things can also lead to greater success because it allows people to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions to problems. for example, a successful entrepreneur may decide to try a new marketing strategy that is outside their comfort zone. by taking this risk, they may find that the new strategy is more effective than the one they were previously using. taking risks and trying new things can also lead to greater success because it allows people to build confidence. for example, if someone is a successful lawyer, they may decide to take a public speaking course to improve their communications kills. by taking this risk, they may find that they enjoy public speaking and become more confident in their ability to present their ideas. taking risks and trying new things can also lead to greater success because it allows people to build relationships with new people. for example, a successful entrepreneur may decide to attend a networking event to meet new people and build relationships. by taking this risk, they may find that the connections they make at the event can help them take their business to the next level. in conclusion, successful people should take risks and try new things rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. taking risks and trying new things can lead to greater success because it allows people to expand their knowledge and skills, think outside the box, build confidence, and build relationships with new people.",0,0,0.0001472811871942501

"dear state senator , i am writing to express my opinion on the electoral college system used to elect the president of the united states. while some argue that the electoral college is outdated and unfair, i believe it is still a valuable system that serves important purposes. firstly, the electoral college ensures that the president is elected by a broad coalition of states, rather than just the most populous ones. this means that smaller states have a voice in the election and arj not overlooked by the candidates. as bradford plum jr notes in his article the indefensible electoral college, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. yet that has happened very rarely plum jr . by using the electoral college, candidates arj incentivized to campaign in a variety of states, rather than just focusing on the most populous ones. secondly, the electoral college provides a mechanism for dealing with the possibility of a tie in the electoral vote. as judge richard a. poster argues in his article in defense of the electoral college, a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible it happened in 2000 but it s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote poster . this is because the winner of the electoral college vote is required to receive a majority of the electoral votes, rather than just a plurality. this ensures that the president is elected with a clear majority, rather than being forced into a runoff election. thirdly, the electoral college helps to prevent the faithless elector problem. as poster notes, in the 1960 election, segregationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing",0,0,0.013345761399239204

"as an eighth grade student, i believe that accomplishing goals is possible by working on them each day. this is something that i have learned through personal experience, and it is a concept that is especially important when it comes to combating racism. one of the most important things about working on a goal is to break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. this allows you to focus on one thing at a time and make steady progress towards your ultimate goal. for example, if you want to become a better student, you might start by setting a goal to study for a certain amount of time each day. you could then break this down into smaller goals, such as completing a certain number of pages in a textbook or practicing a certain number of math problems. another important aspect of working on a goal is to be consistent in your efforts. it is easy to get discouraged when you don't see immediate results, but it is important to remember that progress takes time. by consistently working towards your goal, you will eventually see results and feel a sense of accomplishment. this concept of breaking down and working on goals is especially important when it comes to combating racism. racism is a complex issue that cannot be solved overnight, but by working on it each day, we can make progress towards a more just and equitable society. for example, if you want to combat racism in your school, you might start by setting a goal to educate yourself and others about the issue. you could then break this down into smaller goals, such as reading a book about racism or having a conversation with a friend about the topic. it is also important to be consistent in your efforts to combat racism. this might mean speaking out against racist behavior when you see it, or taking action to support marginalized communities. by consistently working towards this goal, we can make progress towards a more just and equitable society. in conclusion, i believe that accomplishing goals is possible by working on them each day. this is a concept that is especially important when it comes to combating racism. by breaking down our goals into smaller, more manageable pieces and being consistent in our efforts, we can make progress towards a more just and equitable society.",0,0,2.7705147245799514e-05

"dear senator, i am writing to express my support for changing how we elect the president of the united states from the current electoral college system to a national popular vote. while the electoral college was established by the founders with the aim of giving smaller states more influence, i believe it no longer serves that purpose and has some significant downsides. one argument made in favor of keeping the electoral college is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaigns in more states. however, research shows that in recent elections candidates have focused their efforts only on swing states that could vote either way. this means that voters in the vast majority of non swing states see little campaigning. using a popular vote would encourage candidates to campaign across the entire country and address issues important to more americans. it is also argued that without the electoral college, candidates might only focus on densely populated areas. however, we live in a different era than the founders, with modern communication technology allowing candidates to easily reach voters anywhere. a popular vote would reflect the preference of all americans regardless of where they live. some also claim the electoral college protects small states, but in reality it can result in a president being elected despite losing the national popular vote. this has occurred a few times in history and erodes many americans' confidence in the democratic process. in conclusion, while the electoral college may have served purposes in the past, today it discourages voter turnout, fails to ensure that the candidate preferred by the most americans wins the presidency, and does not operate as intended by the founders. i believe moving to a national popular vote would make our democracy more representative of the will of the people and encourage greater civic participation across the country. i hope you will consider supporting legislation to implement this change. thank you for your consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.0033561370910401666
"driverless cars have been a topic of discussion in the automotive industry for years, and as technology advances, their development is becoming increasingly inevitable. while there are certainly benefits to this innovation, such as increased safety and convenience, there are also many potential drawbacks to consider. personally, i believe that the development of driverless cars should be approached with caution, and that we should be mindful of the potential risks before fully embracing this technology. one of the primary concerns with driverless cars is safety. as the article mentions, there is a debate about whether a machine can truly replace the decisions of a human driver. while automated systems can certainly be programmed to detect and avoid potential dangers, they may not be equipped to handle unexpected situations or complex decision making in the same way that a human driver can. another concern with driverless cars is the potential for increased dependence on technology. as we become more reliant on machines to perform tasks for us, we may lose our own skills and awareness of our surroundings. this could be particularly problematic when it comes to driving, where a disconnection from the act of driving and a lack of situational awareness could lead to dangerous situations. additionally, there are economic and accessibility concerns to consider. the cost of developing and owning driverless cars could be prohibitive for many people, leading to further socio economic disparities. and even if these vehicles were more widely available, there is still the question of whether they would be accessible to all drivers, particularly those with disabilities or other special needs. legal and ethical issues also arise with the development of driverless cars. in the event of an accident caused by technology failure, it may be difficult to determine who is responsible. and there are broader ethical questions to consider, such as how we balance the convenience of driverless cars with the need to prioritize human safety and autonomy. ultimately, while driverless cars may offer some benefits, i believe that we need to approach their development with caution and carefully consider the potential risks and downsides. rather than rushing to embrace this technology, we should take the time to fully understand its implications and ensure that it is truly in the best interest of society as a whole.",0,0,7.198442573584237e-06
"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president by popular vote. as you know, the electoral college is a system in which each state is allocated a number of electors equal to its number of senators and representatives in congress. the electors then cast their votes for president and vice president, and the candidate who receives a majority of electoral votes wins the election. i believe that the electoral college is an outdated and undemocratic system that is no longer representative of the will of the people. in recent years, there have been several elections in which the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election in the electoral college. this has happened twice in the last 20 years, with al gore losing to george w. bush in 2000 and hillary clinton losing to donald trump in 2016. this is an unacceptable result. the president of the united states should be the person who receives the most votes from the american people, not the person who wins a plurality of electoral votes. the electoral college system gives more power to a few swing states, and it disenfranchises voters in states that are considered to be safe for one party or the other. i urge you to support a constitutional amendment to abolish the electoral college and elect the president by popular vote. this is the only way to ensure that the president of the united states is truly the representative of the american people. thank you for your time and consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.014128762187458973

"after school tutoring has become a popular solution for students who struggle with their homework and need extra help to improve their grades. while tutoring can be beneficial, it is important to examine the impact of after school tutoring on student achievement and the role of parents in helping students balance their time outside of school. one of the main benefits of after school tutoring is that it allows students to receive individualized attention from a teacher or tutor. this can be especially helpful for students who are struggling with specific concepts or topics. during the tutoring sessions, students can receive targeted instruction and practice problems that can help them better understand the material and improve their grades. in addition to providing individualized attention, after school tutoring can also help students develop good study habits. tutors can help students learn how to organize their time, set goals, and stay focused during study sessions. this can help students become more successful in their academic pursuits both inside and outside of school. however, there are also potential drawbacks to requiring students to stay after school for homework help. for example, some students may not have access to after school tutoring due to financial constraints or scheduling conflicts. additionally, some students may not be motivated to attend tutoring sessions or may not find the tutoring sessions helpful. parents play an important role in helping students balance their time outside of school. they can encourage their children to prioritize their studies and make sure they are setting aside enough time for homework and other academic activities. parents can also provide support and guidance to help their children manage their time effectively. in conclusion, after school tutoring can be a valuable resource for students who need extra help to improve their grades. however, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and ensure that students have access to the resources they need to succeed. parents also play an important role in helping students balance their time outside of school and achieve academic success.",0,0,3.559463943630761e-05

"i think that students would greatly benefit from the option to attend classes from home through distance learning. there are many reasons why this would be a positive option for students. firstly, distance learning would allow students to learn in a comfortable and familiar environment. for some students, attending school can be a stressful experience, especially for those who struggle with social anxiety or bullying. by being able to attend classes from home, students would be able to learn in a setting that they feel safe and comfortable in, which would help them to focus and retain information better. secondly, distance learning would provide students with more flexibility in their schedules. many students have extracurricular activities or work part time jobs, which can make it difficult to balance school and other responsibilities. with distance learning, students would be able to attend classes at a time that suits them best, which would help them to manage their time more effectively. thirdly, distance learning would allow students to learn at their own pace. every student learns differently and at their own speed. with distance learning, students would be able to pause, rewind, and rewatch lectures as many times as they need to, which would help them to better understand the material. lastly, distance learning would provide students with access to a wider range of courses and resources. some schools may not offer certain courses or electives, but with distance learning, students would be able to access courses from other schools or institutions, which would provide them with a broader range of learning opportunities. however, it is important to note that distance learning would not be suitable for all students. some students may struggle with self motivation and discipline, which could make it difficult for them to keep up with coursework and assignments. additionally, some students may not have access to the necessary technology or internet connection to participate in distance learning, which could create unequal opportunities for students. in conclusion, i believe that distance learning would be a beneficial option for students. it would provide them with a comfortable and familiar learning environment, flexibility in their schedules, the ability to learn at their own pace, and access to a wider range of courses and resources. however, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and ensure that all students have equal access to this opportunity.",0,0,2.589274933791321e-06

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular vote. the electoral college is an outdated institution that is no longer necessary to protect the interests of small states. in fact, it actually disenfranchises millions of americans. in the 2016 election, for example, hillary clinton won the popular vote by over 3 million votes, but she lost the election to donald trump because he won more electoral votes. there are several reasons why the electoral college should be abolished. first, it is undemocratic. the candidate who receives the most votes should win the election, regardless of how many electoral votes they have. second, the electoral college gives disproportionate power to small states. each state is guaranteed at least three electoral votes, regardless of population. this means that a voter in a small state has more power than a voter in a large state. third, the electoral college encourages candidates to focus on a few swing states and ignore the rest of the country. in 2016, for example, trump did not campaign at all in california or new york, because he knew that he had no chance of winning those states. this means that millions of americans were effectively ignored by the candidates. fourth, the electoral college is prone to fraud and error. in 2000, for example, the election was decided by a few hundred votes in florida, and there were many allegations of voter fraud. fifth, the electoral college is not necessary to protect the interests of small states. the senate already gives small states disproportionate power, and the house of representatives is based on population. in conclusion, the electoral college is an undemocratic institution that disenfranchises millions of americans. it encourages candidates to focus on a few swing states and ignore the rest of the country. it is prone to fraud and error. and it is not necessary to protect the interests of small states. i urge you to support abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular vote. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.004252623240302863

"the face on mars, also known as the martian face, is an intriguing geographical feature on the red planet. it's a mesmerizing sight for many space enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists who believe that it could be a sign of intelligent life on mars or even an ancient monument left by an extraterrestrial civilization. however, the scientific community has a different explanation for the face on mars. the feature, located on the slopes of aureum chaos in the cydonia region, is a result of natural processes like weathering and erosion. the face is actually a mesa, which is a flat topped landform formed by the differential erosion of surrounding rock. in this case, wind and erosion have shaped the rocks on the mesa into the appearance of a face with eyes, a nose, and a mouth. the illusory appearance of the face on mars has led to a great deal of speculation. some people argue that it's a sign of intelligent life, asserting that its design and symmetry could only be created by an advanced civilization. however, this claim is unfounded. the fact is, natural processes can produce intricate and even seemingly intentional structures, like dripstone formations in caves and even the face like appearance of a mountain range in utah. in conclusion, while the face on mars may be an awe inspiring sight and a fascinating topic of discussion for those interested in space exploration and extraterrestrial life, the scientific explanation for its formation is much more straightforward. the face is a result of geological processes and not an indicator of intelligent life on mars. as our exploration of our solar system continues, we'll undoubtedly uncover even more mysteries and wonders in our cosmic neighborhood.",0,0,0.019050191488522904

"exploring venus is undeniably worth the risk the pursuit of scientific discovery holds great rewards, but often presents real dangers as well. in his article the challenge of exploring venus, the author argues that studying venus remains a worthy goal despite the immense challenges it poses. through specific evidence from the harsh conditions on venus, the author makes a compelling case for why learning more about our neighboring planet is worth risking great hardship. the author first details just how unforgiving the venusian environment truly is. its surface temperature of over 800 degrees fahrenheit would melt lead, and its atmosphere exerts over 90 times the pressure found at earth's surface due to its dense carbon dioxide composition. merely surviving even brief exposure to these conditions seems impossible. however, the author explains that much can still be learned from robotic probes designed to withstand such extremes. for example, we have gained valuable insights into atmospheric dynamics and the potential for life elsewhere by hardening our technology to probe venus's poisonous climate. next, the article discusses the intriguing geological discoveries that further venus exploration could reveal. landers may uncover clues to how the planet transformed from a possibly habitable world into the inferno it is today. comparing venus to earth could yield important lessons in climate change and greenhouse gases. the recent discovery of volcanic activity on venus suggests its geology remains active today, with unknown implications. clearly, more study of our sister planet holds answers to profound questions about planetary evolution. in sum, the author provides strong support for the proposition that researching venus merits enduring its hazards. even though direct human exploration is implausible now, steadily innovating our probe technology to gradually expand our knowledge of venus piece by piece is worthwhile. the potential scientific payoffs in fields from astronomy to climate science demonstrate why tackling venus's challenges remains a worthy endeavor, as does satisfy our innate drive to explore the unknown. for these reasons, the author makes a persuasive case that venus studies are an invaluable pursuit regardless of the immense risks.",0,0,0.006767003598267147
"in today's modern world, technology is an integral part of everyone's lives. from the social media platforms that people use to stay connected with others to the devices that allow us to work from anywhere in the world, technology has undeniably reshaped the way that people communicate. unfortunately, this has led to the limitation of physical human contact, which has had numerous negative impacts on people's health. recent studies have found that people who spend less time engaging in face to face, social interactions are more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, and feelings of loneliness. but why is that? simply put, it's because physical interaction is necessary for human connection. without it, people do not get the validation and emotional support that they need in order to lead healthy and fulfilling lives. furthermore, people have become dependent on technology as a crutch they utilize it as a way to feel connected with others, even when they don't have any real human contact. this disrupts the natural cycle of social interactions and disconnects people from reality, making it difficult for them to form meaningful relationships with others. my own personal experience has demonstrated the importance of human contact in maintaining one's mental and physical well being. when i was stuck at home last year due to the pandemic, virtually every interaction i had was through a laptop or phone screen, and i really started to feel the negative effects of it. i found myself anxious and overwhelmed, and i often felt lonely and isolated. it was only when i was able to get out of the house and meet with a few friends in person that i was able to gain back my sense of control and calm my frazzled nerves. and while the use of technology will always be necessary in our lives, we must remember to prioritize real human interaction as an essential component of our health and well being.",0,0,0.0001601125972720125

"the face on mars is a captivating feature found on the martian surface, and its mysterious appearance has sparked numerous debates, theories, and discussions within the scientific community. first discovered in 1976 by nasa's viking 1 orbiter, this geologic formation resides near the cydonia region of mars. the face itself appears as a human like visage, with two prominent eyes and a nose like protrusion. it measures approximately 0.5 miles 0.8 km wide and 0.3 miles 0.5 km tall. since its initial discovery, the face on mars has generated numerous hypotheses regarding its origin and significance. some of the more prominent theories include 1. natural formation proponents of this theory argue that the face is simply an example of a naturally occurring rock formation, shaped by erosion, impact craters, and wind erosion. 2. artificial construction this hypothesis posits that the face on mars was constructed by an intelligent alien civilization. proponents argue that the symmetrical design and human like features suggest that it could not have been created by chance. 3. pareidolia this theory suggests that the human like appearance of the face on mars is merely an illusion, a psychological phenomenon known as pareidolia. pareidolia is the tendency for the brain to interpret random patterns or objects as recognizable shapes, often resembling faces. 4. hoax or misidentification some skeptics argue that the face is simply the result of image processing errors, misinterpretation, or outright hoaxing. 5. geological processes this theory suggests that the face was created by geological processes, such as erosion, volcanoes, or even water. despite these theories, there is no concrete evidence to support any specific explanation. further research and exploration by nasa missions, as well as advancements in technology, could potentially provide more information on the origin of the mysterious face on mars.",0,0,0.0020227855275463482

"honesty is a virtue that is highly valued in society. it is the foundation of trust and respect, and it is essential for building and maintaining healthy relationships. in today's world, where people often prioritize their own interests over others, it can be tempting to lie or deceive in order to achieve our goals. however, i believe that honesty is the best policy, and there are several reasons why. firstly, honesty allows for open and transparent communication. when we are honest with others, we create an environment where people feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings. this can lead to stronger and more meaningful relationships, as people feel heard and understood. for example, if a friend is struggling with a problem, they may be hesitant to open up if they feel like they cannot be honest with you. however, if you always maintain an honest and non judgmental attitude, they may feel more comfortable sharing and seeking your help. secondly, honesty promotes accountability and responsibility. when we lie or deceive, we take responsibility for our actions, but we also create a situation where we cannot be held accountable for our mistakes. if we are honest, we can learn from our mistakes and work towards making things right. for example, if a student cheats on an exam, they may feel like they got away with it, but they also missed out on the opportunity to learn and improve their skills. thirdly, honesty can help us build character and integrity. when we consistently choose honesty over dishonesty, we demonstrate our commitment to doing what is right. this can help us develop a strong sense of self respect and self worth, as well as respect from others. for example, if a job candidate is honest about their qualifications and experience, they are more likely to be seen as trustworthy and reliable, which can lead to better job opportunities. in conclusion, honesty is the best policy because it allows for open and transparent communication, promotes accountability and responsibility, and helps us build character and integrity. while it may be tempting to lie or deceive in certain situations, the benefits of honesty far outweigh the risks. by consistently choosing honesty, we can create stronger and more meaningful relationships, learn from our mistakes, and develop a strong sense of self respect and self worth.",0,0,6.8891871971981135e-06

"the advantages of limiting car usage are very simple. for one, the amount of polution would drop. the amount of polution would drop mayorly because with everyone driving cars there would be more polution but if we change that make people not use cars at all the polution rate would drop. the passage states, ...passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe...and up to 50 percent... in the united states. limiting the amount of car usage would help by not causing smog clouds throughout cities. paris, france in puting a ban on driving due to smog. if people drive there they would be fined of 22 euro thats like 31. smog makes it hard to breathe because its like if you're breathing polution and thats not good for people. as source 2 states, cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. that means that the car emissions stay trapped here and cant get out so what happens the we breathe that in all that smog and polution goes into our lungs and such.",1,1,0.9995857568409897

"sir winston churchill remains a powerful example of perseverance and success despite failure. churchill was a british statesman most famously known for his leadership during ww2. however, his successes as a politician did not come easy. despite experiencing a multitude of failures early in his life, he refused to give in and kept pushing himself forward, ultimately becoming one of britain's most legendary figures. his famous quote, success is not final, failure is not fatal it is the courage to continue that counts , emphasizes the importance of not giving up in the face of difficulty, instead persevering and striving for success. to understand better how to continue striving in the face of repeated failure, let s examine a hypothetical scenario. a student is struggling to pass a difficult college course and has already failed the course four times. it would be easy for the student to become disheartened and give up, especially with the overwhelming challenge of preparing for and taking yet another exam. but that student must remember churchill s advice and take courage in the knowledge that failure can lead to success if it is met with dedication and consistency. to support not losing enthusiasm after failure, an essay should emphasize that life is full of challenges and how failure is inextricably linked to success. point out the detrimental mental, emotional, and physical effects of allowing the persistence of failure to cause someone to give up. remind readers that a success story is more than just endings and that the path to success is likely to be filled with setbacks. finally, encourage readers that re centering and recalibrating after failure is a normal part of life and essential for anyone seeking to reach their goals. on a personal or professional level, it is important to remain consistent and not give up after failure. through researching the achievements of winston churchill and exploring a hypothetical scenario, it has become clear that the courage to continue despite failure is the only way to experience lasting success.",0,0,0.0010074204783169106
"dear principal i've heard of the new cell phone policies, one where we get to use our phones during lunch and free time, or don't use our phones at all. i think policy 1 is better than policy 2, not just because i'm a student but because i think it's better. policy 1 states allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. i think that sounds way better that not having phones at all. just think about it, what if something happens to a students mom and she cant take her son home, and if she tries to contact him, he wont be able to know because you chose policy 2. but if you chose policy 1, the student would call his mom back during lunch or free time and find out what happened. see, that makes policy 1 sound way better than policy 2. now, what if their are some sneaky students and want to text in class? well, tell the teachers to have a box and collect all of the student phones in the begging of class and return them back to the students at the end. it's that simple! this is just my opinion, but if you like it then thank you and i hope you choose policy 1.",1,1,0.9633326492602005

"i believe that our school should adopt a model that extends the school day by two hours. this model has been successfully implemented by some businesses in order to conserve energy and resources. by extending the school day, students will have more time to become involved in their apprenticeships and school activities. this idea has its advantages and disadvantages. on one hand, it can help students become more engaged and motivated. on the other hand, some students may struggle to adjust to the new schedule, and some may have work commitments that would make it difficult for them to attend school for an extended period of time. however, i believe that the benefits of this model outweigh the drawbacks. one of the main advantages of this model is that it would allow for the creation of new classes such as workshops, drama, and art studios. students would have the opportunity to participate in a wide range of activities that would help them develop skills that would be useful in their future careers. for example, students who are interested in joining the military could take advantage of a program like forty, which would provide them with valuable knowledge about the military and its benefits. some people may argue against this model, citing the fact that they don't like school already or that they think that students don't need that much time at school. however, i believe that by giving students more time at school, they will have the opportunity to learn more and develop the skills they need to succeed in their future careers. additionally, by offering more breaks and activities, students will be able to better manage their time and avoid burnout. in conclusion, i believe that our school should adopt a model that extends the school day by two hours. this model has been successfully implemented by businesses and would provide students with more time to become involved in their apprenticeships and school activities. by offering new classes and programs, students will have the opportunity to develop the skills they need to succeed in their future careers.",0,0,0.00016533984935146353
"it is often said that young people enjoy life more than older people do. while this may be true in some cases, i would disagree with this statement overall. there are many factors that contribute to how much someone enjoys life, and age does not necessarily determine how much someone can appreciate life. to begin with, age is not the only factor that affects how much someone enjoys life. someone s life experiences, outlook on life, and even their personality can all play a role in how much they appreciate life. for example, someone who is naturally optimistic and has had positive life experiences is likely to enjoy life more than someone who is pessimistic and has had negative life experiences, regardless of their age. similarly, someone who is open minded and adventurous is likely to enjoy life more than someone who is close minded and unadventurous, regardless of their age. additionally, there are certain advantages that come with age that can make life more enjoyable. for example, older people often have more financial stability than younger people, which can make life more enjoyable. they may be able to afford nicer things, take more vacations, and generally have less financial stress. additionally, older people often have more life experience and wisdom, which can make life more enjoyable. they may be better able to handle difficult situations, have a better understanding of the world, and be more capable of making wise decisions. finally, older people often have more meaningful relationships than younger people. as people age, they often have more time to invest in relationships and build deeper connections with others. this can make life more enjoyable, as meaningful relationships are often one of the most rewarding aspects of life. in conclusion, while age can certainly affect how much someone enjoys life, it is not the only factor. life experiences, outlook on life, personality, financial stability, wisdom, and meaningful relationships can all play a role in how much someone appreciates life. therefore, i would disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do.",0,0,0.001565031889817832

"dear state senator , i am writing to express my opinion on the electoral college system used to elect the president of the united states. while some argue that the electoral college is outdated and unfair, i believe it is still an essential part of our democratic process. one of the primary arguments in favor of the electoral college is that it ensures a more accurate reflection of the popular vote. as bradford plume notes in his article the indefensible electoral college, the winner of the popular vote has only lost the presidency five times since 1824. this is due to the fact that the electoral college system awards electoral votes based on the number of representatives each state has in congress, rather than the total population of the state. this means that smaller states have a disproportionate amount of influence in the election, which can lead to a more representative outcome. another argument in favor of the electoral college is that it encourages candidates to campaign in a wider range of states. as judge richard a. poster notes in his article in defense of the electoral college, the winner take all system used in most states means that candidates have a strong incentive to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. this leads to a more engaged electorate in those states and ensures that the president elect has a broad base of support across the country. however, there are also counterarguments against the electoral college. one of the most common criticisms is that it can lead to a candidate winning the presidency without receiving the most popular votes. this is exactly what happened in the 2000 election, when george w. bush won the presidency despite losing the popular vote to al gore. this can be seen as undemocratic and unfair to voters who supported",0,0,0.000349599885422678

"dear principal, i am writing to you regarding your proposal to require all students to perform community service. while helping our community is extremely important, i do not believe making it mandatory is the best approach. requiring community service runs the risk of diminishing its positive impact. when people volunteer of their own free will and choice, they are more invested in the work and find it much more meaningful and rewarding. forcing students to volunteer simply to fulfill a requirement may cause them to view it as a chore rather than an opportunity. as a result, the quality of their work and the experience may suffer. however, i do think encouraging and promoting volunteer opportunities is highly beneficial. our school could partner with local organizations and suggest ways students can get involved, from assisting at shelters to helping with environmental cleanups. leaving it as an option, rather than an obligation, allows those who are passionate about particular causes to pursue work they find fulfilling. it also respects students' differing priorities and commitments outside of school. rather than making it mandatory, our school could celebrate and recognize students who volunteer their time through programs, awards or additional credits. seeing their peers praised for volunteer work may inspire others to participate out of their own interest. community participation should stem from personal motivation to help others, not just to fulfill a requirement. while the value of volunteering cannot be overstated, requiring community service risks having the opposite of the intended effect. i believe our school's goals would be better served by promoting and incentivizing voluntary opportunities, allowing students' individual interests and commitments to direct their involvement in ways that are most impactful and rewarding. please let me know if you have any other questions. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.0008004115820890745

"driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, are vehicles that can sense their surroundings and navigate without a human operator. these futuristic cars are being developed with the goal of improving road safety, reducing traffic accidents, and making transportation more efficient and accessible for everyone. one of the primary advantages of driverless cars is the potential for significantly reducing traffic accidents caused by human error. by removing the need for human drivers, these vehicles can make split second decisions based on real time data from sensors that are constantly monitoring their surroundings. this could lead to fewer accidents and a safer driving experience for everyone on the road. another benefit of these autonomous vehicles is their potential to alleviate traffic congestion. with the ability to communicate with other cars and infrastructure like traffic signals, driverless cars can optimize routes, reduce travel times, and potentially even create smarter traffic systems. additionally, driverless cars could provide increased accessibility and mobility for people with disabilities, elderly individuals, or those who may not have a driver's license. this can help reduce social isolation and improve quality of life for these populations. however, there are some challenges that still need to be addressed before driverless cars can be widely adopted. for example, concerns about cybersecurity, privacy, and the reliability of autonomous vehicle technology must be addressed. moreover, regulatory frameworks and infrastructure must also be developed and implemented to accommodate these vehicles. despite these challenges, the advancements in autonomous vehicle technology are promising and have the potential to significantly improve our daily lives. as research and development continue, it's important to consider the various implications and work towards creating a safe, accessible, and efficient future for transportation.",0,0,8.04800954859954e-06
"hey there! i'm a 6th grader, and i'm here to share my thoughts on renewable energy. so, there's been a lot of talk about switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. some people think it's a great idea, while others aren't so sure. let me tell you why i think it's a good idea to make the switch. first, renewable energy is, well, renewable! that means it won't run out like fossil fuels will. we can keep using it over and over again without worrying about it disappearing. plus, it's way better for the environment. fossil fuels release bad stuff like carbon dioxide into the air, which contributes to climate change. but renewable energy sources like solar and wind power don't do that. they're like superheroes for the planet! another thing is that renewable energy is getting cheaper and cheaper. like, have you seen those cool solar panels on people's roofs? they're way more affordable than they used to be. and companies are even investing in renewable energy because it's becoming more cost effective. it's like, why not choose the cheaper, cleaner option? now, some people might say that renewable energy isn't always available, like when it's cloudy or the wind isn't blowing. but that's not a good enough reason to stick with fossil fuels. we can figure out ways to store the energy, like in big batteries or something. and scientists are working on making renewable energy more reliable all the time. okay, so some people might also say that switching to renewable energy will be hard and take a long time. but that's not true! we can start by using renewable energy for little things, like powering our homes or schools. and then we can gradually switch over to bigger things, like cars and factories. it'll take some time, but it's totally doable. in conclusion, we should totally make the switch to renewable energy. it's better for the planet, it's getting cheaper, and it's not as hard as people think. so, let's do this! let's be the superheroes of the planet and save the world with renewable energy!",0,0,0.00025405568380136687
"the topic of this essay is the benefits of playing sports. sports are an integral part of life, providing endless opportunities to engage in physical activity while gaining valuable skills and having fun. from making new friends, learning discipline, and keeping our bodies healthy, there are many advantages to participating in sports. first off, playing sports can help build strong friendships with teammates who share a common interest. these relationships often last long after the sport has been completed due to the bond built through competition and hard work together on the field or court. whether it s basketball or tennis, playing team based sports makes for stronger friendships than individual activities such as running or weights. in addition to forming relationships with other players, participating in organized sports teaches discipline by instilling focus and dedication towards improving one s game over time thus developing self discipline that can be used outside team practices as well. this increased attention span and sense of commitment helps those involved achieve their personal goals quicker than if they were working alone on similar tasks without any structure or guidance from coaches or captains. . finally, engaging in regular exercise through sport keeps us fit both mentally and physically two elements we all need for a balanced lifestyle throughout adulthood once our athletic years come to an end. research shows that individuals who stay active have less risk of medical problems such as heart disease later down life compared to those who remain sedentary for most days out of week creating further importance for getting involved with organized sporting activities during youth years when more energy is available for use in those circumstances instead aging adults who might already have health issues present prior participation even being considered by themself. . overall then it s clear that playing sports offers immense benefits including better physical health along with improved social connections amongst peers leadership experience via taking charge captain role which leads growth deep connection between members within same squad team ultimately resulting higher level success whatever goal happens set particular season timeframe whether recreational event",0,0,0.002379407860371064

"i believe that while having a positive attitude can certainly help individuals achieve their goals and be successful in life, it is not the only factor. in fact, there are many successful individuals who have achieved their goals despite having a negative attitude at times. therefore, i disagree with the statement that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. firstly, it is important to note that success is not solely defined by financial gain or material possessions. success can also come in the form of personal growth and fulfillment. for example, an individual who has a passion for a particular hobby or interest may not have a positive attitude towards their career or financial situation, but they may still be successful in pursuing their hobby or achieving their personal goals. secondly, it is possible for individuals to have a positive attitude towards their goals, but still face obstacles and setbacks that prevent them from achieving success. for example, an athlete who has a positive attitude towards their training and goals may still struggle with injuries or other setbacks that prevent them from achieving their full potential. finally, it is important to recognize that success is not solely determined by individual effort and attitude. external factors such as luck, privilege, and opportunity also play a significant role in determining success. for example, an individual who comes from a privileged background may have more opportunities and resources at their disposal, which can greatly impact their ability to achieve success. in conclusion, while having a positive attitude can certainly help individuals achieve their goals and be successful in life, it is not the only factor. there are many successful individuals who have achieved their goals despite having a negative attitude at times, and external factors such as luck, privilege, and opportunity also play a significant role in determining success. therefore, i disagree with the statement that a positive attitude is the key to success in life.",0,0,1.9302843346154111e-07

"dear principal, i am writing to you regarding the school's cell phone policy and to share my thoughts on which option would be most suitable. after considering both potential policies, i believe policy 1 is the better choice. there are a few key reasons why allowing phones during lunch and free periods is preferable to a total ban. firstly, in today's world phones have become an essential part of teenagers' lives. they provide a way for students to stay in touch with parents and friends outside of school hours. many students rely on their phones to coordinate activities and transportation after school. an outright ban would cause undue stress and inconvenience. during lunch and breaks, phones do not disrupt learning. secondly, a limited use policy is more reasonable. teenagers will inevitably have their phones with them regardless of rules. a total ban may encourage rebellious behavior and create an us vs. them mentality between students and administration. policy 1 sets clear boundaries while still acknowledging that phones are a reality. this balanced approach fosters better cooperation. finally, phones can sometimes enhance the school experience if used properly. for example, they allow quick fact checking and idea sharing during projects. an outright ban discourages any responsible, educational uses of technology. in conclusion, policy 1 seems the fairer option as it respects students' modern needs and responsibilities while still prioritizing classroom focus. phones remain useful tools when limits are set. i hope you will consider this perspective as you make your decision. please let me know if you need any other thoughts on this issue. thank you for your consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.006837547757262467

"i think that summer projects should be student designed. it's important for students to have the opportunity to take ownership of their learning and have a say in what they want to learn. when students are able to design their own projects, they are more invested in the learning process and are more likely to be motivated to complete the project. this also helps students develop important skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, and time management. additionally, student designed projects allow for more creativity and innovation. students are able to choose topics that they are passionate about and design projects that are tailored to their interests. this can lead to more engaging and meaningful learning experiences. for example, a student who is interested in photography can design a project that involves taking pictures of different landmarks in their community, while a student who is interested in science can design a project that involves conducting experiments and collecting data. on the other hand, teacher designed projects can be too rigid and may not take into account the individual interests and needs of each student. when teachers design projects, they may have a set outcome in mind and may not be open to changes or modifications. this can limit the creativity and autonomy of students and may lead to a less engaging learning experience. however, it's also important to note that some students may struggle with designing their own projects, especially if they lack experience or confidence. in these cases, teachers can provide guidance and support to help students develop their ideas and ensure that their projects are feasible and aligned with learning objectives. in conclusion, student designed summer projects offer many benefits for students, including increased motivation, creativity, and autonomy. while there may be some challenges to implementing student designed projects, with the right support and guidance from teachers, students can have valuable learning experiences that they will remember long after the summer break is over.",0,0,4.39696620141674e-06
"the importance of sports in a child's life cannot be understated. athletics provide children with a way to learn the basics of teamwork, develop physical and mental endurance, and build self esteem. from an early age, regular participation in team sports can help instill confidence and teach young people invaluable lessons about working together. teamwork is one of the most important skills any individual can possess it is essential for success at almost all levels of society, from professional organizations to social groups. participating in team activities such as soccer or basketball helps kids learn how to communicate effectively with each other while achieving common goals on the field or court. in learning these vital skills during their childhood years, children are preparing themselves for future obstacles that may arise as they become adults. physical exercise is also incredibly beneficial for growing minds and bodies engaging in sport provides many health benefits including improved cardiovascular fitness, better coordination and balance, increased strength and stamina, as well as higher metabolic rates which contribute to weight management over time. furthermore, athletics give children a sense of discipline which they carry into their academic pursuits later on studies have shown that students who take part in school sports perform better academically compared to those who do not participate due to increased concentration levels associated with consistent exercise habits acquired through organized play practice sessions throughout their childhood years leading up until high school graduation day and beyond! . . finally perhaps most importantly playing regularly encourages positive self esteem because it gives them opportunities where they get recognition when performing well by either winning games tournaments or scoring impressive points against opponents! this provides them with a strong sense of accomplishment fulfillment which lasts beyond the game itself making it much easier for them to tackle everyday problems without feeling inadequate or helplessly overwhelmed by their seemingly insurmountable challenges ahead! it creates an environment full of motivation positivity resulting in greater personal resilience when facing difficult times regardless if we're talking about something like scholastic difficulties encountered during summer",0,0,0.0004561895794968746
"the passage set provides valuable information on this topic, highlighting the decline in car ownership and usage among americans. this trend not only aligns with president obama's goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but also has positive impacts on the environment and society. firstly, reducing car usage means reducing carbon emissions, which contribute to climate change. according to the passage, americans are driving fewer miles per person, which has led to a significant drop in carbon emissions. this is a positive step towards mitigating the impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and air pollution. by limiting car usage, we can reduce our carbon footprint and contribute to a healthier environment. secondly, limiting car usage can also have positive impacts on society. the passage suggests that societal factors, such as internet based work and socializing, urban revitalization, and evolving commuting habits, are contributing to the decline in car ownership. this means that people are finding alternative ways to commute, work, and socialize, which can lead to a more connected and sustainable community. for example, using public transportation, biking, or walking instead of driving can promote physical activity, reduce traffic congestion, and increase social interactions. furthermore, limiting car usage can also benefit the automobile industry. the passage states that companies are adapting to the trend by expanding into broader mobility services. this means that companies are exploring alternative ways to provide transportation, such as car sharing and ride sharing services, which can be more environmentally friendly and cost effective. by embracing these changes, the automobile industry can not only survive but also thrive in a society that values sustainability. in conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reducing carbon emissions, promoting sustainable communities, and benefiting the automobile industry. as a 10th grade student, i believe it's important to be aware of these benefits and to take action to reduce our reliance on cars. by choosing alternative modes of transportation, supporting sustainable policies, and embracing technological innovations, we can create a better future for ourselves and for generations to come.",0,0,1.5543798226384506e-06

"dear senator, pensive and melancholic, the debate on whether or not the electoral college should be kept has had the people thinkinf for many years now. as you already know the process of the electoral college consists of electors meeting and voting for the president and vice president. therefore, the people voting only help choose the state's electors when voting for their president. in reality, we all know that when we vote we are actually choosing our candidate's electors. because of this the people feel like their voice isn't being heard. they believe that they aren't actually voting for their president. for starters, the majority of people, over 60 percent of the voters, would prefer a direct election instead of having an electoral college. under the system we have now voters can't always control who their electors vote for. sometimes there is a problem where we choose the wrong elector and in turn vote for the incorrect candidate. the majority of people voting feel that their vote does not really count because electors can go against what they promised, and they can vote for whoever they wanted to vote for. in addition to this, there is a problem if there is a tie in the electoral votes. in the event of this the election would be passed to the house of represenatatives. this means that it is up to state delegations to vote on the president.",1,1,0.9991440012499778

"the electoral college is an essential part of the american presidential election process. however, the effectiveness of the electoral college in ensuring fair representation and accurately reflecting the popular vote is a matter of debate among scholars and citizens. on one hand, the electoral college system has several advantages. first and foremost, it prevents the tyranny of the majority by ensuring that smaller states are given a voice. the founding fathers intentionally designed the electoral college to protect states with fewer citizens from being dominated by more populous states. this system ensures that every american's vote has equal value, regardless of where they reside. additionally, the electoral college provides a check on the potential abuse of power by the presidential candidate. the electoral college consists of a group of electors who cast their votes for president and vice president based on the popular vote in their respective states. these electors serve as a buffer between the voters and the president, ensuring that the president elect has a broader support base. however, there are some disadvantages and concerns about the electoral college system. one significant issue is the winner take all approach in many states. this means that the winner of the popular vote in a state receives all of its electoral college votes, regardless of the margin of victory. this can lead to situations where one candidate wins the popular vote but loses the election due to the electoral college. moreover, there have been several instances in u.s. history when the electoral college has not accurately reflected the popular vote, such as in the elections of 1824, 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016. in these instances, the candidate who received more votes did not become president. the electoral college's failure to accurately represent the popular vote has led to concerns about its fairness and effectiveness. in conclusion, the electoral college has both pros and cons. while it protects the interests of smaller states, ensures a diverse support base for the president elect, and prevents the tyranny of the majority, it can also lead to situations where the candidate with the most popular votes does not become president. ultimately, the effectiveness of the electoral college depends on one's perspective and their opinion on whether the system should prioritize representation or accurately reflect the people's choice.",0,0,0.0004730551779311852

"title exploring venus venus, the second planet from the sun, has been a topic of great interest for many years. it's often referred to as earth's twin planet because of its similar size and mass to earth. however, there are several significant differences that make venus an incredibly unique and fascinating place in our solar system. 1. surface conditions venus' surface conditions are extreme. the atmosphere is made up of carbon dioxide, and the planet is covered in thick, toxic clouds that are composed mostly of sulfuric acid. temperatures on the surface can reach up to 864 f 462 c , making it the hottest planet in the solar system. these conditions make it impossible for humans to visit venus without proper spacecraft and protective suits. 2. atmosphere venus' dense atmosphere plays a crucial role in shaping the planet's surface. the high pressure caused by the dense atmosphere has led to the formation of mountains as tall as mount everest. however, the extreme conditions also make it challenging to explore the planet. scientists have primarily relied on spacecraft to learn about venus' surface and atmosphere. 3. volcanic activity venus is known for its active volcanic activity. unlike earth, which has a few active volcanoes, venus has numerous volcanically active regions. the constant volcanic activity on venus may help to explain the presence of its thick atmosphere. 4. magnetic field venus is the only planet besides earth to have a magnetic field. however, its magnetic field is much weaker than earth's. scientists believe that venus' magnetic field might have weakened because its core is cooling down. 5. possible life forms venus may have hosted life at some point in the past. scientists have found possible signs of phosphine, a chemical compound associated with life, in its thick clouds. however, more research is required to confirm whether these findings are indeed indicators of life or not. in conclusion, venus is an intriguing and unique world in our solar system. with extreme surface conditions, an atmosphere that is both thick and toxic, and possible signs of life, there is still much for scientists to learn and explore on our neighboring planet.",0,0,0.0018424495478717522
"dear principal, i have noticed you were deciding to make a new policy and were deciding between allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during their own time, or not having students bringing cell phones at all. as being a student, i think cell phones are highly important because they are used everyday for personal reasons. i strongly believe that you should allow students to bring their phones and only allow them to use their phones during their own time. from past experiences, there are many times when something last minute comes up and you need to call a parent or guardian to see what is going on. students with cell phones can easily call or text their parent or guardian and find out the answer. it is a quick and simple thing to do. but if you do not have cell phones allowed at school, you would have more students needing to use the office's phone for just the silliest little things. it would cause students to have to constantly use the office phone and would cause you to have anther thing to stress about. another reason students should have their cell phones is because there are certain situations when something embarrassing happens and you would rather talk to your parents in private than having to go to the office. if you talk to your parents on a cell phone, you can go somewhere private to talk to them. if you go to the office, anybody can go in and hear what you are saying. you can't get complete privacy and even if you talk low enough, the person on the other line might not be able to hear you. finally, allowing students to have cell phones is also a way of trusting us. taking cell phones away will cause us to believe you don't trust us. if you have not been hearing complaints from teachers about students cheating with cell phones, there really isn't any purpose of you having to take them away. in conclusion, cell phones are fairly important to the students and should be allowed in school. they are necessary for information on rides and mishaps. we should be trusted with them. if some students don't respect the rules, not everyone should be punished. that is why i think cell phones should be allowed in school.",1,1,0.9918995789166553
"the face on mars, also known as the cydonia mensae formation, has been a topic of fascination and mystery for space enthusiasts since it was first discovered by nasa's viking 1 orbiter in 1976. this enigmatic feature on the martian surface resembles a human face with two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. scientific theories about the face on mars range from it being a natural geological formation to an artificial structure created by an extraterrestrial civilization. the most widely accepted explanation for this feature is that it is a natural formation, specifically a mesa flat topped hill or an eroded rock formation. however, the resemblance of the face on mars to a human face has not stopped people from speculating about its origin. some believe that it could be a remnant of an ancient martian society, while others think it could be a result of intelligent lifeforms from another planet or galaxy. despite these theories, scientists have not found any evidence to confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life on mars or that the face on mars is an artificially created structure. further research and exploration are required to fully understand the origins of this fascinating feature. in conclusion, the face on mars is an enigmatic and intriguing feature of the martian landscape that has captured the imagination of people worldwide. while its true origin remains unknown, it is essential for scientists and space enthusiasts to continue investigating and exploring the mysteries of our universe to uncover its secrets.",0,0,0.00030802453713307424

"limiting car usage environmental and social benefits there are compelling reasons why limiting car usage could positively impact communities. reliance on personal vehicles as the primary mode of transportation creates various issues related to traffic, pollution, and public health. by promoting alternatives like walking, cycling, and public transit, citizens and leaders can help address some problems facing modern cities and suburbs. one major advantage is improving air quality and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. as the passages note, vehicle exhaust contains harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and carbon dioxide. the latter is a contributing factor to climate change. when there are fewer cars on the road each day, the levels of these substances in the atmosphere decrease. this enhances environmental sustainability long term. it also means less smog and better breathing conditions for residents including children and the elderly. in addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage could lead to healthier lifestyles. the passages discuss how overreliance on automobiles has contributed to less physical activity and higher rates of obesity. by opting for active transit like biking or walking short distances instead of driving, people incorporate more movement into their daily routines. this in turn promotes cardiovascular and overall wellness. communities may see public health outcomes improve as noncommunicable diseases linked to sedentary living become less prevalent. encouraging multimodal transportation also helps tackle traffic congestion issues confronting many urban areas. when driving is not the only viable choice, there will be fewer vehicles competing for road space during rush hours according to the provided sources. this reliefs pressure on infrastructure and makes commutes more efficient for those who still need cars. it could even support local businesses if shoppers feel comfortable walking or cycling around commercial districts. in summary, limiting car usage yields environmental, health and quality of life advantages when alternatives are accessible. pursuing a balanced mix of transportation modes allows communities to prioritize sustainability, wellbeing and efficient systems all at once. with collaborative efforts, cities and citizens can work to curb reliance on personal vehicles and reap multiple long term societal benefits.",0,0,0.0001610516847383908
"have you ever wondered how you would get through the day without a car to drive you to school, afterschool clubs, soccer practice and home at the end of the day? in several places around the world citizens are cutting down, or off,with their car usage and starting to transport themselves by bycicle or walking. vauban, paris and bogota residents have described this new way of living as stress reducing and has also been a domino effect for places around the world! the first point, described by previous car owners in vauban, germany is the lack of stress in their life after the conversion to a no car lifestyle. when i had a car i was always tense. i'm much happier this way. citizen heidrun walter described the change as positive even while juggling her full time jobs of being a media trainer and mom. the loss of time spent in traffic has produced a more relaxed lifestyle in bogota, colombia as well. carlos arturo plaza, citizen, explains that the switch as a good opportunity to take away stress. as a whole, nobody likes to sit in traffic and walking or riding a bicycle to work makes one less thing you have to worry about. having citizens convert into not using automobiles full time also produces the domino effect. for example, because of bogota using this lifestyle the colobian cities of cali and valledupar have followed in their lead. as well as the obvious that this change brings, is also is shedding off on other places that want to improve their surroundings. with other cities, countys or even countries joining in, we can slowly make the world a healthier place. in conclusion, limiting car usage has brought positive effects on the cities of vauban, paris and bogota. these places have shown signs of lower stress and an easier way of life. many other places have been adding on to the trend and can make the world a much less polluted and better place to be.",1,1,0.9891222788027649

"do i think that using technology to read emotion expressions of students in a classroom is valable you may ask, it is a marvoulous idea. technology has come so good in the past 17 years. i remember back in 2000 when the flip phones had just come out and fast forwars 17 years later we now have a computer that can read anyones facial expression and tell us how they are feeling. i can't even begin to imagine how much more advanced technology is going to get later on in life, it already seems to be that we could possibly have all the technology we could ask for, yet people all around the world just seem to be getting better and thinking of smarter ways to invent new things. why is this a good idea you may ask. for starters if technology will be able to read kids expressions while learning and being in class for teachers there will be one very good benifit. a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored dr. huang predicts this is going to be a very good thing for teachers, because teachers will be able to know what a kid is feeling this means that the teach will no longer have to keep going over the same information with the same kids just because one kid does not understrand it or isnt paying attention. the teacher can focus on those targeted students spicificly, and not have to go over the same information multiply times. knoledge is a great thing to have. one good benifit from this is that teachers can teach more to kids in a more faster way so they can get more things done, because the facs will tell you if the kids understands the information and or get bored that way techers can work with those kids in a different time and move on to more things with the kids that do understand it. having computers that can read kids expresions to tell you whether you are bored or confused is a genius idea. it will be a good thing for both reachers and kids. the science behind it is also neat for people to understand how it came about the facs.",1,1,0.9997722889538385

"the facial action coding system facs is an important tool used in the study of facial expressions. it is a standardized method for identifying and categorizing the movements of muscles in a person's face, which can help in understanding the emotions and intentions conveyed through facial expressions. developed by dr. paul ekman and his colleagues, this coding system breaks down the facial movements into 37 distinct actions or actions units. these actions include movements such as raising the eyebrows, narrowing the eyes, and tightening the muscles around the mouth. by identifying these movements, researchers can analyze facial expressions across different cultures and situations, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of human emotions and communication. the facs has been widely applied in various fields, including psychology, sociology, and computer science. it has helped researchers study how facial expressions are related to emotions and how they can be detected and interpreted by machines. additionally, the facs has been used in the development of facial recognition systems and in creating more realistic facial animations in films, television shows, and video games. in education, the facs can be utilized as a teaching tool to teach students about the intricacies of facial expressions, empathy, and emotional intelligence. understanding the facs can enable individuals, especially children and teenagers, to better recognize, understand, and express their own emotions and those of others. in conclusion, the facial action coding system is an essential tool for understanding and analyzing human emotions and facial expressions. its standardized approach to categorizing facial movements has numerous applications in various fields, including education, psychology, and computer science. by learning about the facs, students can develop a deeper understanding of emotions and improve their emotional intelligence, making them better communicators and more empathetic individuals.",0,0,9.07444542535857e-06

"the so called face on mars is simply a natural landform and was not created by aliens. while the distinct shape of the landform resembles a human face, leading some to believe it was an artificial structure, evidence clearly shows it was formed through natural geological processes over time. the article provides strong evidence that supports the face being a natural landform rather than anything artificial. it describes how images of the landform taken at different times show erosion and changes to its appearance, proving it evolved naturally rather than being a static structure. wind and other naturally occurring weather on mars would shape and reshape sand and rocks over many years into varied formations that may occasionally resemble patterns we recognize. the face also aligns with surrounding hills and its units were deposited horizontally, as is typical for natural rock and soil layers formed by weathering. some key details further validate the natural origins of the face. its scale suggests any responsible beings would need to be impossibly large. the lack of any other artificial structures nearby makes the lone face implausible. geological analysis identifies the rocks comprising the face as typical martian sediments, not unique composites one would expect from artificial building. changes observed prove it underwent weathering with the martian climate rather than remaining pristine intact as an artificial object presumably would. in conclusion, while speculation about the face being an artificial construct created by aliens makes for an interesting hypothetical, evidence overwhelmingly shows it was formed through natural geological processes. the visible changes, alignment with surrounding terrain, and identification as typical sedimentary rocks provide strong scientific proof the so called face on mars is simply a curious but natural landform sculpted by planetary conditions, not created by extraterrestrial visitors. unless definitive evidence of artificial nature emerges, it remains rationally classified as a product of geological forces alone.",0,0,0.06942436638089518

"to speak truly, in my opinion, it's necessary for the goverment to spend money on building theatres and sports statiums. it's not that i don't like sports, i do, but i think that it is a waste of money to build a sports stadium in a city that doesn't have a lot of people who want to go to the games. i'm not saying that there aren't people in the city who would like to see a baseball game or a football game. the problem is that most of the stadiums are built in places where there are very few people. i think it would be a good idea to put some money into building hospitals and schools. if you look at the number of children who die every year from diseases that are preventable, you will see that the majority of those deaths are caused by lack of health care. in the united states, we spend about 1.5 trillion a year on healthcare, which is more than any other country on the planet. we spend less than half of what other developed countries spend, and yet we have the highest infant mortality rate and the lowest life expectancy of any developed country. why? because we are the only country that does not provide universal healthcare to all of it's citizens. that's why i say that we need to invest in education and healthcare.",0,0,0.2905716441122754
"dear principal, i believe that students should be allowed to use their cell phones during school hours, with certain restrictions in place. while it is important that students remain focused on their studies, there are times when they may need to use their phones for important reasons, such as contacting friends or family members who are not at school or seeking help with a problem. one of the main reasons i support this policy is that students often have important matters to attend to outside of school, such as appointments or errands. allowing them to use their phones during school hours can ensure that they are able to stay on top of these responsibilities and avoid any potential conflicts or disruptions. additionally, students may need to use their phones for emergency purposes, such as in the event of an accident or medical emergency. allowing them to have access to their phones during school hours can provide a sense of security and peace of mind, knowing that they can quickly reach out for help if needed. of course, it is important that students are not allowed to use their phones during class or other times when they are expected to be focused on their studies. however, there should be a clear and consistent policy in place to ensure that students understand the rules and are held accountable for their actions. in conclusion, i believe that allowing students to use their cell phones during school hours, with appropriate restrictions, is a reasonable and necessary policy. it can help students stay on top of their responsibilities and provide a sense of security and peace of mind, while still ensuring that they remain focused on their studies when necessary. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.00013905277946945371
"driverless cars are a futuristic dream for many people. but now that they are becoming a reality some people support driverless cars and some do not support driverless cars. driverless cars can be dangerous and could fail and hurt someone. driverless cars should not be sold or used until they fix the danger involved. making them safe for the public to drive. danger is a big worry to the world, understandably to because many people die in automotive accidents. some beleive that driverless cars can solve that danger involved in driving. but in truth it could be more dangerous than a human driving. the technology involved in everyday life can be troublesome and does not want to work all the time, so the technology involved in driverless cars could easily behave the same way. most people have had a problem with their wifi or their phone acting up and not working before. the technology in driverless cars could just as easily do the same thing, and that could indanger millions of people. driverless cars take away human control and human error, but it gives control to technology and computers, in turn giving way to technology errors. many people dont want their families getting hurt do to a technology error when they could of had control and been fine. human control is very important when talking about families and friends. so until they can be absolutly sure the technology wont fail and can maintain control driverless cars should not be driven for everyday use.",1,1,0.999895416330837

"as an eighth grade student, i believe that transitioning from a junk food cafeteria menu to a healthier one is a crucial step in ensuring the well being of students. in this essay, i will analyze the benefits of such a change and provide real life examples of positive outcomes that have been observed as a result of it. firstly, a healthy diet has been linked to numerous health benefits. for example, consuming a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. furthermore, a healthy diet can improve cognitive function, including memory, attention, and concentration. these benefits are particularly important for students, who spend a significant portion of their day in school, where they need to stay alert and focused. secondly, a healthy diet can also help students maintain a healthy weight. according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc , childhood obesity rates in the united states have tripled since the 1970s, with nearly one in five children classified as obese. this is a significant public health concern, as obesity is associated with numerous health problems, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer. by transitioning to a healthier cafeteria menu, students can make healthier food choices, which can help them maintain a healthy weight and reduce their risk of these health problems. finally, there are numerous real life examples of positive outcomes from transitioning to a healthier cafeteria menu. for example, the los angeles unified school district lausd implemented a healthier menu in its schools in 2010, which included more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. as a result, the district saw a significant reduction in the number of students who were overweight or obese, as well as a decrease in the number of students who were absent from school due to illness. similarly, the new york city department of education implemented a healthier menu in its schools in 2012, which included more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, as well as a reduction in the amount of sodium and sugar in school meals. as a result, the department saw a significant reduction in the number of students who were overweight or obese,",0,0,1.8304177210146695e-07
"should we stop trying new things in our lives? it is a question that has been debate for centuries, with some people arguing that we should stick to what we know any have, while others believe that we should always be learning any trying new things. while i agree with the sentiment expressed by ralph waldo emerson, i believe that there is value in both learning new things any helping others. firstly, learning new things is essential for personal growth. it allows us to expand our horizons any challenge ourselves to think outside the box. for example, if we are in a job that we fine monotonous any lacks' excitement, we can learn new skills or take on new responsibilities to make our job more interesting. similarly, if we struggle with a particular math problem, we can learn new techniques or strategies to solve it. by constantly learning any trying new things, we can become more wellrounyey individuals any achieve our full potential. secondly, helping others is an important aspect of life. we never know when we may near help ourselves, any by learning new things any sharing our knowledge with others, we can be there to help them when they near it. for example, if we know how to rise a bike, we can teach someone else how to to it. if we are skilled in using a computer, we can help others learn how to use it. by helping others, we not only make their lives easier, but we also feel a sense of price any fulfillment in knowing that we have made a difference. in conclusion, while it is important to learn new things any try new things, it is equally important to help others. by constantly learning any growing, we can become better versions of ourselves any make a positive impact on those around us. so, i encourage everyone to step out of their comfort zones any try new things, while also being there to help others when they near it.",0,0,0.010142562859265724
"the electoral college has been a part of the american electoral system since the country's founding, with its purpose being to elect the president and vice president. it is a unique method of choosing these high officeholders, and it works differently from the popular vote, where a candidate wins by securing the majority of votes cast. the electoral college consists of 538 electors, allocated among the states based on population and congressional representation. each state is given a number of electors based on the number of senators 2 and representatives based on the state's population . the district of columbia also gets three electors, bringing the total number to 538. on election day, people do not vote for the president they vote for electors who represent their chosen party's candidate. the electors then gather and cast their vote for the president and vice president. to win, a presidential candidate must receive a majority of electors' votes currently 270 out of the possible 538 . the electoral college has both advantages and drawbacks. it allows for a more balanced distribution of power among the states, as each state has some level of influence in the election process, even those with lower populations. additionally, the electoral college prevents a small number of highly populated states from dominating the election. however, it has also led to some undesired consequences such as a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the presidency. this happened in 2016 when hillary clinton received over two million more popular votes than donald trump but lost in the electoral college. furthermore, the electoral college system can be manipulated in ways that disenfranchise certain populations or states. in conclusion, the electoral college does work in the context of its intended purpose, which is to elect the president and vice president. however, its effectiveness is debatable, as it may not accurately represent the popular will or provide a fair and balanced system for all americans. as such, there has been a continuous debate on the merits and potential reform of the electoral college.",0,0,0.07962562676629674
"the facial action coding system facs is a method used in the study of facial expressions. developed by dr. paul ekman and dr. wallace friesen in the 1970s, facs is based on the idea that every facial expression involves the contraction or relaxation of specific facial muscles. the system categorizes these movements into distinct action units, which can be combined to create various facial expressions. facs consists of 43 action units, which are organized into six basic emotions happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. each action unit represents a specific muscle movement in the face, such as raising the eyebrows, tightening the lips, or wrinkling the nose. the system has been widely adopted in the field of psychology, as well as in various other disciplines like animation, acting, and even law enforcement. it helps researchers and professionals in understanding the complex nature of facial expressions, and how different combinations of action units can convey various emotions and intentions. facs has also been used to study cross cultural similarities and differences in facial expressions. while some actions units are universal across cultures, others may differ based on cultural influences and societal norms. this knowledge is essential for creating accurate representations of emotions in various settings, such as in movies or video games. in summary, the facial action coding system is an important method for analyzing and categorizing facial expressions. it provides a framework that allows researchers and professionals to study emotions, create realistic representations, and better understand the intricacies of human communication through facial expressions.",0,0,0.00020894939047829108
"i believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts then it is for them to learn facts. i think that this is because facts can be easily forgotten, while ideas can be remembered and used throughout one's life. for example, let's sky that you are studying for k test and you know that you need to know the facts about the united states constitution. however, you also know that you need to understand the idea of the constitution in order to answer the questions on the test. therefore, i believe that it is more important for students to understand the idea of the constitution then it is to know the specific facts about it. another example of why it is more important for students to understand ideas rather then facts is that facts can be easily changed or disputed. for example, if you were to study the history of the united states, you might learn that the united states was founded in 1776. however, if you were to study the history of the united states and discuss the idea of the united states, you could potentially argue that the united states was founded in 1776 because of the declaration of independence. therefore, facts can be changed, which can make it difficult for students to remember and use the information. finally, i think that it is important for students to understand ideas because they can be used to solve problems. for example, if you are studying for k math test and you know that you need to solve k problem that involves fractions, you might be able to solve the problem by understanding the idea of fractions. this is because fractions are k way of dividing numbers into smaller parts. therefore, by understanding the idea of fractions, you are able to solve the problem that you were originally trying to solve.",0,0,0.0005816408213282466

"standardized testing has been a topic of debate ford any years. some people believe that these tests are an accurate measure of student ability, while others disagree. in dy opinion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability. firstly, standardized tests only measure a student's ability to take a test. they do not take into account a student's creativity, critical thinking skills, or problem solving abilities. these skills are just as important as a student's ability to deodorize information and take a test. for example, i know any students who struggle with standardized tests but excel in other areas. one of dy friends is an amazing artist and can create beautiful paintings, but she struggles with death and science tests. another friend is a great public speaker and can communicate her ideas effectively, but she struggles with dultiplechoice tests. these students are talented and intelligent, but their abilities are not reflected in their standardized test scores. secondly, standardized tests are biased against certain groups of students. for example, students who speak english as a second language day struggle with the language used in the tests. additionally, students food coincide families day not have access to the sade resources and support as students food wealthier families, which can impact their test scores. lastly, standardized tests put too such pressure on students and teachers. teachers are often evaluated based on their students' test scores, which can lead to a narrow focus on test preparation rather than a well rounded education. students also feel the pressure to perform well on these tests, which can lead to anxiety and stress. in conclusion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability. they only measure a student's ability to take a test and are biased against certain groups of students. additionally, they put too such pressure on students and teachers. instead of relying solely on standardized tests, we should focus on providing a well rounded education that values creativity, critical thinking, and problem solving skills.",0,0,0.00036063807845637176
"introduction hey there! i came across an article titled unmasking the face on mars and it got me thinking. a lot of people believe that the face on mars is a sign of alien life, but i'm here to tell you why i think it's just a natural landform. i'm not saying aliens don't exist, but let's look at the science behind this formation. body firstly, the face on mars is not a perfect rectangle or square, it's actually a triangle. the article states that the face is a result of erosion and weathering, which makes sense when you look at the shape. it's not a neatly carved structure, it's a natural formation that has been shaped by the planet's harsh conditions. secondly, the face is not unique. the article mentions that there are similar formations on earth, like the mesabi iron range in minnesota. these formations are also triangular and have similar features to the face on mars. this tells us that the face is not a one of a kind structure, but rather a common natural formation. thirdly, the article mentions that the face is not symmetrical. if it were created by aliens, wouldn't they want it to be perfect and symmetrical? instead, the face has irregularities and imperfections, which suggests it was formed naturally. lastly, the article states that the face is not a recent formation. it's been around for millions of years, long before humans even existed. this means that even if aliens did visit mars, they wouldn't have had the chance to create the face. conclusion in conclusion, the face on mars is not a sign of alien life. it's a natural landform that has been shaped by erosion and weathering over millions of years. the irregularities and imperfections of the face suggest it's not a man made structure, but a natural part of the martian landscape. i hope this essay has convinced you that the face on mars is not a sign of alien life, but a fascinating natural formation.",0,0,0.0015769658333436975

"summer breaks in most countries are 4560 days long. students mostly enjoy the summer by going to a vacation or doing fun stuff. from students' point of view, 60 day summer break is the last thing they want to lose. however, most student lose track of their studies after spending such a long break away from school. furthermore, being 60 days away from your frisbee practice would massively impact your game and the same applies to studying, you will forget most of the lessons that you've learned. one might say, well there are summer classes to keep students connected with their studies. but to be absolutely honest, no one wants to go to school in a hot summer day. we all want to lie low and have a cold drink in beach while listening to the satisfying sound of waves. what is the solution? put an end to long summer breaks not completely removing them , and instead give students a week off after every 4 week of studying. it gives students and the faculty a brief break after every 4 week, and also it gives students time to work on their important projects. for instance, if i'm studying history of us museums, i can get a chance to explore the museums and write an article of my own observation about museums in my area. student can't get everything done on weekends, so they need more time. teachers on the other hand can keep track of the students during the 7 day break and ask them for their progression. moreover, this gives students to participate in community services and or religious services, which in my opinion, are crucial in building one's character. the summer break, however, is still there but shrank to 2 weeks, giving students a chance to go on vacations and trips but not for long. all in all, 7 day break after every 2 week of school keeps students involved and connected to their studies, community and religion while giving them the freedom they need to enjoy their summer without losing track of all the studies.",1,1,0.9413562067180605
"car free cities a vision of sustainability and quality of life as a high school or middle school student, i find car free cities fascinating. imagine living in a city where you could walk, bike, or use public transportation without having to worry about the hustle and bustle of cars on the streets. this is a concept that has gained popularity in recent years, and it's no surprise. car free cities are not only environmentally friendly but they also promote healthier lifestyles, safer streets, and a stronger sense of community. one significant advantage of car free cities is the positive impact on the environment. cars emit greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. by eliminating cars, cities can significantly reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to a healthier planet. moreover, car free cities often prioritize public transportation and bicycle infrastructure, which can lead to reduced energy consumption and improved air quality. in addition to environmental benefits, car free cities also foster a more active lifestyle. people living in these cities tend to walk more, bike more, and engage in physical activities that help maintain a healthy lifestyle. this, in turn, reduces healthcare costs and improves overall well being. another advantage of car free cities is improved street safety. with fewer cars on the roads, pedestrians and cyclists can enjoy a safer commuting experience, reducing the risk of accidents and injuries. this is especially important for children, who can play and socialize more freely in car free streets. furthermore, car free cities promote a stronger sense of community. when people rely on walking, biking, or public transportation, they tend to interact more with one another. this leads to a stronger sense of community and a more connected city. in conclusion, car free cities offer numerous benefits, from environmental sustainability to improved health and safety. as a middle or high school student, i am excited about the potential of such cities to shape a better future for our planet and for the people who live on it.",0,0,9.81930509524865e-05

"as an eighth grade student, i believe that committing to a career at a young age can have both advantages and disadvantages. while it is important for students to have a sense of direction and purpose, it is also important to be open to new opportunities and experiences. one advantage of committing to a career at a young age is that it allows students to focus their efforts and resources on achieving their goals. by setting a clear path for themselves, students can work towards their desired career with more determination and focus. additionally, committing to a career at a young age can give students a sense of purpose and direction, which can be beneficial for their mental and emotional well being. however, there are also potential disadvantages to committing to a career at a young age. for example, students may miss out on other opportunities and experiences that could help them grow and develop as individuals. additionally, the job market is constantly changing, and what may seem like a promising career path today may not be as viable in the future. in terms of current trends, there is a growing movement towards delaying the decision to commit to a career. many experts believe that students should take the time to explore their interests and gain experience in different fields before making a long term decision. this can help students make more informed decisions about their career path and increase their chances of success. despite these potential disadvantages, there are many examples of people who have found success in committing to a career at a young age. for example, oprah winfrey started her career as a news anchor at the age of 19, and went on to become one of the most successful media personalities in history. similarly, mark zuckerberg started facebook at the age of 23 and it is now one of the most successful social media platforms in the world. in conclusion, while committing to a career at a young age can have advantages, it is important for students to be open to new opportunities and experiences. by taking the time to explore their interests and gain experience, students can make more informed decisions about their career path and increase their chances of success. ultimately, the decision to commit to a career at a young age should be based on individual circumstances and goals.",0,0,2.071812237665728e-06

"i disagree with requiring all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. while extracurriculars provide many benefits, mandating participation prevents students from having choices that align with their individual needs, interests and circumstances. every student is different, with unique strengths, challenges and priorities. forcing involvement in extracurricular activities ignores these differences and can negatively impact students' wellbeing and education. some prefer focusing on academics, others have family responsibilities or jobs that demand their time after school. competing priorities should not be dismissed. extracurriculars are best pursued voluntarily, as additional enrichment opportunities rather than compulsory obligations. when students have autonomy in choosing how to spend their free time, they are more likely to engage in activities they genuinely enjoy and find meaningful. forced participation runs the risk of resentment and halfhearted involvement that does little to cultivate the teamwork, leadership and time management skills extracurriculars aim to develop. it's also unreasonable to assume all students have the physical ability, financial means or availability to accommodate a mandatory extracurricular on top of their coursework. instead of requiring acrosstheboard participation, a better approach is providing students with options and encouraging them to find activities aligned with their priorities and talents. xhe benefits of extracurriculars like learning time management and collaboration are best realized when students choose involvement based on personal motivation rather than compulsion. overall wellbeing and academic success are maximized by policies respecting individual circumstances and preferences for how students direct their energy outside the classroom. for these reasons, i do not think making extracurricular participation a requirement is the right decision.",0,0,6.925199245371969e-05

"to whom it may concern, with all the problems affiliated with the electoral college, i believe that the united states should do away with the process. this process by which the president is elected is unfair to those of us who are old enough to wrote and understand politics. another disadvantage is that the system of electoral college is very confusing to many people. the worst thing about the electoral college is that it is just outright puzzling. men who are running for a spot as a presidential candidate are not noted for by the citizens of that state. they have to gain supporters who then become the electors. then the people of that state have to wrote for the electors, not the person to become a presidential candidate. goters can't even directly wrote for whom they want. what if you wrote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidential candidate you want, but don't wrote for him? what happens then? presidential candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral notes. this all leads to the next disadvantage of the electoral college, unfairness. as stated in an article by bradford plume, ... al gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular wrote but lost the presidency. the person running for president should be noted for directly by the waters. someone, such as al gore, can get enough of the popular notes, but not enough of the electoral notes because they can't swing the notes in some states. this basically means that the majority of the united states would like to have al gore as a president, but couldn't because the majority of people in a state didn't want him as president. to sum it up, the electoral college should be eliminated from the presidential voting process. people should just directly wrote for whom they want as president and see where it goes from there.",1,1,0.9989331712641918

"i think social media has a big impact on society norms and values. firstly, social media platforms like instagram and tiktok have created a new kind of social currency, with people competing to get likes, followers and views. this can lead to people doing crazy things to get attention, like posting risky or inappropriate content, or even bullying others to get a reaction. this can create a culture where people feel like they need to be constantly performing and validated by others, which can be really harmful. another way social media affects society norms is by creating echo chambers. people tend to follow and interact with others who share their own beliefs and values, which means they're not exposed to different point of views. this can make people more extreme in their beliefs and less willing to listen to others. it can also spread misinformation and fake news, which can be really dangerous. furthermore, social media has made it easier for people to bully and harass others. cyberbullying is a huge problem, and it can have really serious effects on people's mental health. also, social media can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and reinforce negative attitudes towards marginalized groups. for example, there's a lot of body shaming and fat shaming on social media, which can make people feel bad about themselves and their bodies. however, there are also positive ways in which social media can impact society norms and values. social media can bring people together and help them feel more connected and less lonely. it can also provide a platform for people to share their stories, experiences, and perspectives, which can help to raise awareness and challenge harmful stereotypes. in conclusion, social media has a big impact on societal norms and values. while it's true that can be negative effects, such as echo chambers, cyberbullying and body shaming, there are also positive ways in which social media can bring people together and help to challenge harmful stereotypes. overall, i believe that social media has significant impact on society, but we need to be careful about how we use it.",0,0,4.271687354503438e-06

"making mona lisa smile , published by the american psychological association, discusses how a new technology called facial action coding system facs can be used to analyze human emotions. this technology has potential implications for various fields, including education. however, the article raises significant concerns about the use of this system in classroom settings. firstly, it questions the necessity of using facs in educational settings where human interaction is fundamental. the author points out that human beings naturally possess the ability to read and respond to emotions, making the use of this system redundant. this raises questions about whether the costs associated with acquiring and implementing this technology justify its use. secondly, the use of emotional recognition technology raises significant privacy concerns. although the system is effective in recognizing emotions such as confusion or boredom, it does not understand the underlying causes of these emotions. in a classroom setting, students bring their personal experiences and emotions that may not be directly related to the classroom. therefore, implementing this system would require careful consideration of individual students' privacy rights. finally, the article highlights the practical and financial constraints involved in integrating emotional recognition technology into education. although this technology could help teachers adapt teaching methods in real time to maintain student engagement, it raises feasibility questions in a group setting. furthermore, implementing personalized emotion detecting computers for every student would be impractical for most educational institutions due to the financial costs involved. in my opinion, while the concept of using technology to analyze human emotions is fascinating, it is unnecessary in classrooms. the benefits of this technology do not outweigh the potential costs and privacy concerns involved. human beings are naturally skilled at recognizing emotions and responding appropriately, making the use of this technology redundant. furthermore, implementing this technology could lead to privacy breaches in classrooms, which is not worth the potential benefit of increased engagement. in conclusion, while technological integration in education is essential, it is crucial to consider the privacy and practical implications of implementing such technology. the value of human centric teaching methods cannot be overstated, especially in classrooms, where emotional understanding and connection are crucial. as we progress into the age of technology, we must prioritize human touch in education. sources making mona lisa smile by nick d'alto, american psychological association,",0,0,3.213308955395909e-05
"schools that offer distance learning is a open option for student's. can it be beneficial for student's to attend school classes at home as well as video chatting for conferences? my opinion on this statement is distance learning is not beneficial, certain kids take advantage of online schooling to not attend school and to stay at home. most few kids can't learn their material through computer and prefer being in a classroom and being taught verbally. everyone's learning skills are different. online classes are like books on a computer and having to learn all your materials on your own. attending school will help you learn more things about all your subjects. when having trouble with any subject you will have teachers and other students to go to when needed help. distance learning may effect your social life. socializing with other student's at school is a great way to make friends. going to school and having a routine every morning will help you to be independent and having you'r own responsibilities, it will prepare you as you get older. although waking up in the morning can be harsh and very tiring, you must think about the future you want to have. school is where you have opportunity's for many things. doing online classes won't be like going to school where they give you opportunity's to go on field trips and have fun at the dances or participating in sports and clubs. if attending school you can make childhood memories to tell and the long run. distance learning is not beneficial you lose a lot of opportunity's and enjoyments. i have to strongly disagree with doing online classes at home. going to school is where you find yourself and start to plan the future that you want to accomplish.",1,1,0.9954865165974409

"dear senator, i am writing to express my support for the electoral college in the united states presidential election. after reading various articles and analyzing the pros and sons of the electoral college, i have some to the conclusion that it is the most effective and fair way to elect the president of the united states. one of the main arguments in favor of the electoral college is that it ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election. if the president were elected by popular vote, candidates would only focus on campaigning in the most populous states, ignoring the needs and concerns of smaller states. this would lead to a lack of representation for these states and their citizens. furthermore, the electoral college ensures that the president is elected with a broad base of support. a candidate must win a majority of electoral votes, which means they must appeal to voters in various regions of the country. this ensures that the president is not just popular in one area, but has support from a diverse group of voters. while some argue that the electoral college an lead to a candidate winning the presidency without winning the popular vote, this has only happened a few times in history. additionally, in these cases, the candidate still had to win a majority of electoral votes, which means they had broad support across the country. in conclusion, i strongly believe that the electoral college is the best way to elect the president of the united states. it ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election, and that the president is elected with broad support from across the country. i urge you to support the electoral college and to reject any proposals to change to a popular vote system. thank you for your time and consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.0015160901807076868
"natures faces there are many reason to why the face is just a logical thing that can happen. it could've been buttes or mesa landforms that are located in the american west. also, there is no reason nasa would have for trying to hide something so major from the world. lastly, if their was aliens on mars, wouldn't their be more evidence supporting the aliens instead of nothing? garvin from mars global surveyor, talks about how it reminds him of middle butte in the snake river plain of idaho as stated in paragraph 12. anyone could go to middle butte in snake river plain of idaho and see for themselves if they look alike. a simple way to put it is that their are so many things this face could've been other than aliens. which is why most people don't believe in this theory because it is far from practical. although nasa could hide what they saw at mars, why would they? there is no reason for nasa to keep anything they discover a secret, or try and hide anything from us. nasa wouldn't have even shared the photo if they felt that they didn't want for anyone to know, to stir up this controversy in the first place! the astronauts were most likely just as shocked as we were when they saw the image. lastly, there isn't enough evidence to infer that there is any type of life form on mars. in paragraph 9 of the article unmasking the face on mars, it talks about how it isn't easy to target where the face is. if the face was a form of life there would be more, and it probably wouldn't be so hard to find. most likely there wouldn't be one face but many. even with every fact in the world there are still the great questions we all have from time to time. even with the facts we all know about. though i think that there is no possible way there could be any existence on earth. you could always say what if. which is why i hope you take my words into accountance when you think about the face on mars.",1,1,0.9999796808447273

"although technology is advancing and it's fascinating to imagine a future where cars can drive themselves, the reality is that there are too many limitations and potential downsides to justify their implementation. first and foremost, the current technology for driverless cars is not yet reliable. as stated in the article, driverless cars can only handle simple functions at speeds up to 25 mph. beyond that, they require human intervention, and constant vigilance. this means that a driver still needs to be actively engaged, which defeats the purpose of having a driverless car. additionally, the article mentions that manufacturers are considering installing cameras to monitor drivers, which raises serious privacy concerns. the thought of being constantly watched and evaluated by a manufacturer is unsettling, and could lead to increased stress and distracted driving. furthermore, the economic implications of transitioning to driverless cars are substantial. it would require compatible infrastructure such as 'smart roads' that can communicate with the vehicles, which would be exorbitantly expensive. the logistics and financial burden of such a transition are daunting, and it's unclear who would bear these costs. additionally, it would be challenging to ensure that the smart roads are universally compatible with all types of vehicles, both driverless and traditional. instead of investing in driverless cars, we should focus on refining existing technologies that are practical and cost effective. for instance, we could improve the safety features of traditional cars, such as adding automatic emergency braking systems, or improving lane departure warning systems. these technologies have already proven to be effective in reducing accidents, and they don't come with the same limitations and potential downsides of driverless cars. in conclusion, driverless cars are an intriguing concept, but they are not yet a practical solution. we should focus on refining existing technologies that are safe, affordable, and respectful of our privacy. by doing so, we can create a safer and more efficient transportation system, without the need for an unnecessary and costly overhaul of our infrastructure.",0,0,8.221062383305235e-05

the president of the united states should be chosen by popular vote because the electoral college system is unfair. the electoral college system also has many things wrong with it besides being unfair. the electoral system is unfair to voters because many voters can be confused about the elector rather than just voting for presidents directly. it is also unfair that presidential candidate themselves can be electors because not everyone chooses the side that they are supposed to chose. also voters can't always control who the electors vote for either which also make this system very unfair. the fact that winner takes all is the system we use is very unfair to the voter because it doesn't really show true votes only overall votes. although voting for your candidates electors seems easy you can't always trust other people to do the things they are supposed to you can only trust yourself. when you vote for the president you should be directly voting for him or her not voting for an electoral slate. candidates should try to win the vote of everyone no matter what not heavily campaign in some states and rarely campaign in others. this concludes why we should use popular vote.,1,1,0.9997386151075025
"hey there! i'm a grade 7 student and i'm here to share my thoughts on whether zoos should continue to operate or not. so, let's start with the pros of zoos. one really cool thing about zoos is that they help protect endangered species. for example, zoos have breeding programs for animals like giant pandas, which are really rare and need our help to survive. if we didn't have zoos, these animals might disappear forever! zoos also help us learn about animals and their habitats, which is pretty neat. we can observe them up close and personal, and learn about their behavior, diet, and habitat. this can help us figure out how to protect them better in the wild. but, there are also some cons to zoos. for one, it's kinda sad that the animals are stuck in cages and can't roam free like they would in the wild. it's like, i get that it's for their own good and all, but it's still not ideal, you know? also, sometimes zoos can be a bit...boring? i mean, i've been to a few zoos and they're pretty much the same thing over and over. you see a few animals, maybe some elephants or giraffes, but that's about it. it's not super exciting, especially if you've been to a bunch of zoos before. so, after thinking about it, i think zoos should still operate, but we need to make sure they're doing their job right. we need to make sure they're protecting endangered species and teaching us about animals in a way that's fun and engaging. maybe we can have virtual zoos or something, where we can learn about animals without them being in cages? or maybe we can have more interactive exhibits, like where we can see animals in their natural habitats, like a giant panda forest or something? that would be pretty cool! in conclusion, zoos are important for conservation and education, but we need to make sure they're doing their job right. we need to find ways to make them more engaging and fun, while also protecting the animals and helping them thrive. so, yeah, i think zoos should continue to operate, but we need to make sure they're done right!",0,0,0.002413748112106838

"the facial action coding system facs is a method used to analyze and categorize human facial expressions based on the underlying facial muscle movements. developed by dr. paul ekman in the 1970s, this system is essential to the study of emotions, psychology, and communication. the facs consists of 43 distinct facial movements, each assigned a unique number, known as action units aus . these aus are grouped into seven major categories 1. inner brow raiser raising the inner part of the eyebrow 2. outer brow raiser raising the outer part of the eyebrow 3. eye closers closing the eyes completely 4. eye openers widening the eyes 5. eye squint narrowing the eyes 6. eyebrow lowerers lowering the eyebrows 7. lip corner depressors depressing the corners of the lips, making them turn down each facial movement is then broken down into more specific actions. for example au 1 inner brow raiser is further divided into 4 sub actions 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d au 10 upper lip raiser is further divided into 3 sub actions 10a, 10b, 10c in addition to analyzing individual facial movements, facs is also used to identify the combination and intensity of these movements, helping us understand how different emotions and expressions are conveyed through our faces. this system is particularly useful in studying facial expressions in different cultures, as well as for individuals with autism and other developmental disorders, who sometimes have difficulties interpreting or conveying nonverbal emotional cues through their facial expressions. facs has revolutionized the study of human emotions and facial expressions, providing us with valuable insights into the intricacies and subtleties of nonverbal communication. its widespread adoption in various fields continues to make a significant impact on our understanding of human psychology and behavior.",0,0,0.002518137102059242

"the facial action coding system facs is a groundbreaking innovation that has the potential to revolutionize the way we learn and interact in the classroom. this technology, developed by professor thomas huang, is capable of interpreting the subtlest of facial expressions to identify a range of emotions, providing a digital window into the human psyche. the software offers a real time emotional map of the classroom, empowering teachers to tailor their approach to individual student needs, and fostering a sense of community and mutual understanding among students. the use of facs in the classroom is valuable for several reasons. firstly, it allows teachers to understand the emotional state of their students, enabling them to adjust their teaching methods to meet the individual needs of each student. this can help students who may be struggling with a particular concept or feeling overwhelmed, as the teacher can provide additional support and resources to help them better understand the material. secondly, the software can differentiate between confusion and boredom, interest and indifference, allowing teachers to tailor their lessons to the needs of their students. this can help to keep students engaged and motivated, as they feel that their teacher understands and cares about their individual learning experience. furthermore, the technology fosters a sense of community and mutual understanding among students. recognizing that facial expressions are universal, the system helps students see that they are not alone in their emotional responses. this shared understanding can foster collaboration and empathy, breaking down barriers of isolation and misunderstanding. however, some skeptics may argue that the use of facs in the classroom could replace human interaction and empathy. but as dr. huang points out, much of human communication is nonverbal, and the software isn't replacing human interaction it's enhancing it. the technology can help teachers to better understand their students and provide them with the support they need to succeed. in conclusion, the use of the facial action coding system in the classroom is a valuable tool that has the potential to revolutionize the way we learn and interact. it can help teachers to better understand their students, tailor their lessons to individual needs, and foster a sense of community and mutual understanding among students. this technology is a beacon of hope for educational reform, and it could well lie in the digital decoding of our smiles and frowns.",0,0,9.742763736413316e-06
"seeking multiple opinions when making an important decision or asking for advice is often a wise thing to do. talking to more than one person allows you to get different perspectives on your situation and options. each person you speak to will likely have their own unique take and experience to offer you that another person may not think of. this gives you a more well rounded view of whatever choice you are contemplating. for example, if you were trying to decide between two universities to attend, getting input from family, teachers, older students currently attending each school, and anyone else you respect could provide insights you hadn't considered. one person may emphasize academics while another discusses student life or cost of living. weighing all the feedback you receive helps create a fuller picture so you can make a choice based on the factors most important to you and your goals, instead of potentially overlooking something key due to only hearing from one source. different people also catch different things, so the combination of input increases the chances something relevant to your decision will be pointed out. seeking multiple viewpoints also prevents getting stuck on a biased or incomplete perspective. any one person you speak with may unintentionally or intentionally steer you a certain way due to their own preferences or experiences without considering other legitimate options. getting balanced input helps counteract undue influence from a single opinion. the diversity of responses supports coming to your own well informed conclusion. in the end, the choice is yours to make, but sourcing multiple perspectives provides you with more complete material to base your decision on and gives you confidence you have thoroughly examined important decisions from several angles. this approach often leads to choices people feel more satisfied with in hindsight since they put in the effort to gather comprehensive advice before committing.",0,0,0.47556128459816716

"dear principal, i am writing to express my support for policy 1 regarding the school's cell phone policy. while i understand the desire to limit distractions in class, an outright ban on phones is too restrictive and unrealistic. students' lives do not stop at the school gates allowing phones for breaks and free periods would offer a helpful balance. policy 1 recognizes that phones are now an integral part of students' lives. we use our phones to stay connected with friends and family, listen to music, and access helpful apps and information outside of class time. an outright ban would ignore this reality and potentially cause unnecessary conflicts if phones are confiscated. policy 1 is a more pragmatic approach that lets students still access their phones for important personal reasons during designated times. keeping phones turned off during class ensures they will not interrupt or distract from lessons. teachers could still enforce no phone use if a student is not following classwork. but allowing phones for breaks and between classes would help students feel less stressed if they need to check messages from parents on activities after school, coordinate social plans with friends, or access online resources for homework. an outright ban may backfire and cause students to be sneaky with their phones. most importantly, policy 1 treats students with more responsibility by expecting that phones will remain off during class time without being banned completely. students will respect boundaries if reasonable policies acknowledge our digital lives outside school in a balanced way. for these reasons, i believe policy 1 is the most sensible cell phone policy for our school. please let me know if you need any clarification on my views. thank you for your consideration. your name",0,0,0.004169454436838968

"i disagree with the idea of extending the school day, as it would take away a significant portion of the day that students could gse for leisure activities and personal pursuits. this would make many students unhappy, as they would feel like they are missing out on the things they enjoy doing. adding more hours to the school day would not be beneficial, as students would likely feel stressed and overwhelmed. they would be upset with the school for keeping them late and not allowing them to have any free time. this would lead to a decrease in student satisfaction and could even result in lower academic performance. parents would also be unhappy with the new school schedule, as they would not have as much time to spend with their children. this could lead to a strain on the family dynamic and could negatively impact the child's overall wellbeing. furthermore, the idea of extending the school day to accommodate more academic time is not necessarily effective. studies have shown that students who have more free time tend to perform better academically than those who do not. this is because they have more time to focus on their studies and engage in activities that promote learning. in conclusion, extending the school day would not be beneficial for students, parents, or the overall educational system. it would lead to decreased student satisfaction, increased stress and overwhelm, and a strain on family dynamics. instead, schools should focus on providing students with more opportunities for leisure activities and personal pursuits, as well as effective study habits and strategies.",0,0,0.0005350460151470331

"it is true that our modern society is often referred to as a throwaway society due to the excessive amount of plastic bags and other nonbiodegradable materials we produce. this has led to an increase in landfill sites, the destruction of habitats and an increase in plastic pollution in our oceans. i believe this is a serious problem that needs to be addressed and that we should work towards finding a solution to this issue. firstly, the amount of plastic bags that are used and discarded on a daily basis is incredibly concerning. plastic bags are often seen as a convenient solution for carrying items, however, the majority of them are not biodegradable and can the hundreds of years to decompose. this means that these bags will pile up in landfills, pollute the environment and can even be hazardous to animals. even if we are able to find a way to recycle them, many of these bags end up in the ocean, where they have been documented to have a devastating impact on marine wildlife. secondly, while it is easy to blame the individual for being wasteful, we also need to look at the larger corporations and governments that produce and distribute these materials to consumers. companies are often putting profits before the environment and are not held accountable for the damage their products cause. governments should be regulating the production of plastic bags and encouraging businesses to invest in more sustainable alternatives, such as reusable bags or biodegradable bags. they should also be investing in research and infrastructure to help reduce the amount of plastic waste and increase recycling. although it may seem life an overwhelming problem, i believe that change is possible and that we can develop better solutions to our throwaway society . if we all work together to reduce our consumption of single use plastics, pressure corporations to develop more sustainable products and encourage governments to invest in sustainable initiatives, then we can mah a real difference in our environment.",0,0,9.681894325869658e-06
"do we choose our own character traits or is our character formed by influences beyond our control? this is a question that has been debated for centuries. while there are certainly external factors that can shape our character, i believe that we ultimately have the power to choose who we want to be. one of the reasons why i believe we choose our own character is because of the way we are. our personality traits and tendencies are deeply ingrained in us from a young age. for example, some people may be naturally outgoing and extroverted, while others may be more introverted and reserved. these traits are a result of our genetic makeup and upbringing, but they ultimately shape who we are as individuals. another reason why i believe we choose our own character is because of the way we treat others. our actions and behavior towards others are a reflection of our character. if we consistently act in a kind and compassionate manner, we are likely to be seen as a good person. conversely, if we act selfishly and without regard for others, we may be seen as a negative influence. finally, i believe that we choose our own character through the choices we make in life. we have the power to make decisions that shape our future and ultimately define who we are. for example, if we choose to pursue a career that aligns with our passions and values, we are more likely to be harry and fulfilled in life. on the other hand, if we choose a career that we are not passionate about, we may struggle to find meaning and purpose in our lives. in conclusion, while there are certainly external factors that can shape our character, i believe that we ultimately have the power to choose who we want to be. by being mindful of our actions, behavior, and choices, we can shape our character in a way that aligns with our values and passions.",0,0,2.9123211576469793e-05

"the president of the united states is currently determined by an electoral college. the electoral college process involves the public voting for their elector and not the main focus, the candidates. through this, many of the states gain more power than they should, and the votes are set up as a winnertakesall system. this unnecessary and inaccurate use of votes is outdated and needs to be shut down. in an instant, an electoral college voter could change his or her mind and go against his or her original political party. this is a completely unfair use of power because it reverses all the votes that went to the elector and to all the voters who were counting on the elector to properly represent their vote. the voters have no say in whether the elector will stay true to his or her party. the easiest way to prove that the electoral college must go, is to reveal the facts. in source 2 the indefensible electoral college it states over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now . multiple icons such as richard nixon, jimmy carter, bob dole, the u.s. chamber of commerce, and the afl cio have stated they would like to abolish the electoral college as well! we now have the majority vote to put an end to the electoral college and the unfair system. perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, says source 2. a tie in the votes, which is very much possible since the total number of votes is 538, according to source 1, could then allow the fate of america to rest in the hands of the house of representatives, a miniscule representation of the people. if the voting system were to be changed to the popular vote, the results would accurately display the winner that the majority of america chose. it's official the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational, says bradford plume, and he couldn't be closer to the truth. the electoral college system does not represent the people of america accurately and is more likely to result in a tie compared to the popular vote. to conclude, source 3 says the electoral college is a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner .",1,1,0.9968164685220555

"the electoral college system, which is the process by which the united states elects its president, has been in use since the country's inception. while it has its advantages and disadvantages, the effectiveness of the system depends on several factors. advantages of the electoral college include the fact that it helps to balance the power between states with different populations and prevents a few densely populated areas from dictating the election outcome. the college also provides a deliberative process that allows for the selection of qualified individuals who are knowledgeable about national affairs, as opposed to just being popular. however, there are also several criticisms of this system. one major concern is that the electoral college can lead to candidates winning even though they did not receive the most votes nationwide. this happened most recently in the 2016 election, with donald trump winning despite losing the popular vote. this issue raises questions about the fairness and legitimacy of the election process. additionally, the system may encourage candidates to focus on swing states rather than campaigning nationwide, which can lead to unequal attention being paid to different parts of the country. in conclusion, the effectiveness of the electoral college can be debated based on the factors discussed. while it does have its advantages, such as balancing power between states and providing a deliberative selection process, it also has its flaws. these include the possibility of a candidate winning without a majority of the popular vote and the focus on swing states instead of a more comprehensive campaign strategy. overall, the effectiveness of the electoral college depends on one's perspective on the importance of these factors and their impact on the democratic process.",0,0,8.908289174733595e-05
"in recent years, computer games have become increasingly popular among children. while some people argue that computer games have negative effects on children, i disagree with this viewpoint. i believe that computer games can have positive effects on children's physical, intellectual, and psychological development, and that they can be enjoyed in a safe and responsible manner. firstly, computer games can have a positive impact on children's physical development. many computer games require players to move their bodies, such as dance games or motion controlled games. these types of games promote physical activity and can help children develop hand eye coordination and motor skills. research has shown that playing computer games can also improve reaction times, which can be beneficial for sports and other physical activities. secondly, computer games can help children develop their intellectual abilities. many computer games require players to use problem solving skills, strategic thinking, and critical reasoning. for example, puzzle games and strategy games can help children develop these skills. research has also shown that playing computer games can improve cognitive abilities such as memory, attention, and spatial awareness. finally, computer games can have a positive impact on children's psychological development. playing computer games can provide children with a sense of achievement and mastery, which can boost their self esteem and confidence. moreover, many computer games have social components that allow children to interact with other players and develop social skills. of course, it is important to ensure that children play computer games in a safe and responsible manner. parents should monitor their children's gaming habits and set limits on the amount of time they spend playing. they should also ensure that children play appropriate games that are age appropriate and do not contain violent or inappropriate content. in conclusion, i disagree with the notion that computer games have produced more negative effects than positive ones on children's physical, intellectual, and psychological development. while it is important to ensure that children play games in a safe and responsible manner, computer games can have many positive effects on children's development, and can be enjoyed as a fun and educational activity.",0,0,5.439503219772746e-05

"john lubbock was a british naturalist and politician who made significant contributions to the fields of natural history and politics. born in 1836, lubbock was a self taught naturalist who began his career as a teacher before turning his attention to the study of natural history. one of lubbock's major accomplishments was his work on the study of prehistoric man. he was one of the first people to study the remains of early humans, and his work helped to establish the field of prehistory. lubbock's work on prehistoric man also helped to dispel some of the myths and misconceptions about early humans that were prevalent at the time. in addition to his work on prehistory, lubbock was also a prominent political figure. he was a member of the liberal party and served as a member of parliament for several terms. lubbock's political career was marked by his commitment to social reform and his advocacy for the rights of workers. lubbock's success as a politician and naturalist can be attributed to his ability to make his own decisions. unlike many other british politicians of his time, lubbock was not bound by the traditional political ideologies of his time. instead, he was guided by his own beliefs and values, which allowed him to forge his own path and create a unique difference in the political world. lubbock's ability to make his own decisions was also a key factor in his success as a naturalist. unlike many other naturalists of his time, lubbock was not content to simply follow the established scientific methods of his time. instead, he was willing to challenge conventional wisdom and develop his own methods for studying the natural world. this willingness to think outside the box allowed lubbock to make significant contributions to the field of natural history. in conclusion, john lubbock's ability to make his own decisions was a key factor in his success as both a politician and a naturalist. by following his own beliefs and values, lubbock was able to forge his own path and create a unique difference in the political world. similarly, by challenging conventional wisdom and developing his own methods for studying the natural world, lubbock was able to make significant contributions to the field of natural history. overall, lubbock's ability to make his own decisions",0,0,1.9395301116977362e-07
"dear my principal!, i agree with you that students should have at least a b in all core classes if they want to participate in any sports. students should not be involved in this case because if we let them do it now then the students will think its all right to fail their classes. if we discipline them then it will encourage students to do well in their classes. if we don't make this policy than the parents of the children might think we don't care about their education. many parents may take their kids out of our school because were not giving a good education. with all the c average students and failing students the school might be one of the worse schools in the state maybe even the country. being one of the worse schools is bad because you will not get any more students the following year. it is also bad because our school could be the only school a child can come to and they cant get their education. i think in every school that should be the case so none of these things can happen. no matter how bad the kids pout or what they say they should not be able to play any sports or do any activities without at least a b. you should tell your students that even though your mad right now about this, one day they will thank me for it. sincerely, a concerned student student name",1,1,0.9999874075506696

"title the face on mars the red planet, mars, has been the subject of countless scientific studies and space explorations. one of the most fascinating discoveries made in the past century is the presence of a distinctive rock formation resembling a face on the martian surface. the face on mars has captured the imagination of scientists and the public alike, fueling debates and theories about its origin, purpose, and potential implications. the face on mars was first observed by the viking orbiter in 1976 and later confirmed by the mars global surveyor in 1998. it is located near the cydonia mensae region, which has a distinctive geological feature known as a mesa a flat topped hill . the face itself measures approximately 300 meters in height, 300 meters in width and 100 meters in depth. the striking similarity between this rock formation and a human face has sparked numerous speculations about whether it is a natural formation or an artificial object. one theory suggests that the face on mars could be evidence of ancient martian civilization or even extraterrestrial involvement. however, scientists have largely rejected these ideas, citing the lack of supporting evidence. instead, they propose that the face is simply a natural rock formation, possibly due to erosion or other geological processes that have shaped its appearance. despite these theories, the face on mars remains an enduring mystery, with no conclusive explanation. the presence of such a distinctive feature raises questions about the geological history of mars, and it continues to fuel the curiosity of scientists, researchers, and the public. in conclusion, the face on mars is a remarkable discovery in the exploration of our celestial neighbor. although its origin is still debated and not definitively understood, the intricate rock formation serves as a testament to the wondrous nature of our universe, sparking our imagination about what might be possible.",0,0,0.0003783982023195319

"while distance learning has its advantages, i do not think it provides as many benefits to students as attending classes in person. some of the key reasons are social interaction is an important part of education. being physically present in a classroom allows students to work collaboratively with peers, engage in group discussions, and build relationships with teachers and other students. this type of social learning is difficult to replicate online. students gain valuable social and communication skills from interacting face to face on a daily basis. distance learning can make students feel isolated as they learn from home without these social connections. it can be challenging for students to stay focused and motivated while learning from home. the classroom provides a structured learning environment where students are surrounded by others also focused on learning. at home, there are many distractions like phones, television, pets, chores etc. that can take a student's attention away from classroom material. it requires great self discipline for young people to learn effectively without these environmental supports that a physical classroom provides. hands on learning is also limited through distance formats. some subjects like lab sciences, arts, trades, and physical education benefit tremendously from hands on demonstrations, experiments and activities that allow students to directly engage with material in person. it is difficult for an online or remote class to provide substitutes for these types of hands on learning experiences. while distance learning can benefit certain students under some circumstances, overall attending classes in person provides students with important social, emotional and educational supports that are challenging to replicate through remote formats. for these key reasons, i believe students are best served by attending physical classrooms versus distance learning from home on a full time basis. targeted or occasional distance options could be beneficial in some cases, but regular in person school remains the preferable approach for most students.",0,0,0.0006437564604780253

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular vote. i believe that this is the best way to ensure that our elections are fair and that all americans have an equal voice in choosing our leaders. the electoral college is an outdated system that is no longer representative of the american people. in recent years, there have been several elections in which the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election. this is undemocratic and unfair, and it undermines the legitimacy of our government. there are several reasons why i believe that we should abolish the electoral college. first, it is undemocratic. the candidate who wins the most votes should be the president. this is the case in every other democratic country in the world. in the united states, however, the candidate who wins the most votes can lose the election if they do not win enough electoral votes. this happened in 2000, 2016, and 2020. it is simply not fair that the winner of an election can be decided by a few thousand votes in a few swing states. second, the electoral college gives too much power to a small number of states. the current system gives all of a state's electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in that state, even if they only win by a small margin. this means that a few states with large populations can have a disproportionate amount of influence on the election. this is unfair to the voters in other states, who have less of a say in who becomes president. third, the electoral college encourages candidates to focus on a small number of swing states. in order to win an election, a candidate needs to win a majority of the electoral votes. this means that they need to focus on winning the popular vote in a handful of swing states. this leaves many other states out of the conversation, and it means that candidates are not as likely to campaign in these states. i believe that abolishing the electoral college would make our elections more fair and democratic. it would also give all americans an equal voice in choosing our leaders. i urge you to support this important reform. sincerely, your constituent",0,0,0.01127568645973857
"the concept of success is often debated among individuals, with many differing opinions on what it means to achieve it. while some may argue that success is the result of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm, i believe that success is the product of persistence and hard work, regardless of the number of failures experienced along the way. firstly, the idea that success is the result of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm is flawed. while it is important to maintain a positive attitude and not give up, it is also important to recognize that failure is a natural part of the journey to success. it is through our failures that we learn and grow, and it is by continuing to push forward, even in the face of adversity, that we ultimately achieve our goals. secondly, the notion that success is only achieved through persistence and hard work is also important. while it is true that some people may be naturally talented or have certain advantages, success is ultimately a result of dedication and effort. it is those who are willing to put in the hard work and never give up, even when faced with setbacks and failures, who ultimately achieve their goals and find success. in conclusion, while the idea that success is the result of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm may be appealing to some, it is ultimately the persistence and hard work that leads to success. it is important to recognize the value of both, but ultimately it is the latter that will ultimately lead to success.",0,0,8.048555869502406e-07

"there is no one answer to the question of whether work is more stressful today than in the past. some people might say that work is more stressful because there is more pressure to produce and to be constantly available. others might say that work is less stressful because people have more options for balancing work and family life. i believe that work is both more and less stressful than in the past. on the one hand, technology has made it possible for us to be constantly connected to our work. we can now work from home, answer emails at all hours of the night, and take work with us on vacation. this constant connection can make it feel like we never really leave work, and can lead to a lot of stress. on the other hand, technology has also made it possible for us to take more time off from work. we can now work remotely, take time off for vacation, and work flexible hours. this flexibility can make it easier to balance work and family life, and can lead to less stress. in conclusion, i believe that work is both more and less stressful than in the past. it all depends on the individual and on the specific situation.",0,0,8.054720988700845e-06
"the facial action coding system facs is a method used to analyze and categorize human facial expressions. developed by dr. paul ekman and dr. wallace friesen, this system has become an invaluable tool for understanding the complexities of nonverbal communication. facs breaks down human facial expressions into distinct movements, or action units. these action units are grouped into seven primary facial expressions happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, disgust, and contempt. each of these primary expressions is then further divided into more specific action units, which can include muscle movements, facial contortions, or other nuanced expressions. this system helps researchers, psychologists, and other professionals in various fields study human emotions and nonverbal communication. for instance, actors and animators utilize facs to accurately depict human expressions in their performances and artwork. additionally, law enforcement and mental health professionals may use facs to identify deceptive behavior or understand the emotions of individuals they interact with. the facs is also helpful in understanding the universality of human expressions across diverse cultures, as the system's categories and action units are based on fundamental human emotional responses rather than cultural differences. this allows people from different parts of the world to communicate and understand each other's emotional state more effectively. in summary, the facial action coding system is a comprehensive and valuable tool for analyzing, categorizing, and understanding human facial expressions. it plays an integral role in numerous fields, from entertainment to law enforcement, and helps bridge cultural barriers by providing a common language for understanding and conveying emotions through facial expressions.",0,0,6.191790067605732e-05

"successful people often have unique qualities that set them apart from the average person. one of these qualities is the willingness to try new things and take risks. i strongly agree that trying new things and taking risks is essential to success. one example of how trying new things and taking risks can lead to success is the case of serial entrepreneur elon musk. musk has founded multiple companies, such as tesla and spacex. these companies were not only ambitious projects, but also entirely new concepts that had never been attempted before. musk took the risk of investing time, money, and energy into these projects, and has been greatly rewarded for his efforts. another example is the case of youtube star lilly singh. singh started her youtube channel in 2010, at a time when few people were aware of the potential of the platform. she was willing to take the risk of investing her time and energy into creating content for youtube, and this risk has paid off. singh now has over 14 million subscribers and has earned multiple awards for her work. trying new things and taking risks can lead to success because these activities open up more opportunities than simply sticking to what one already knows. for example, if an individual only knows how to do one job, they are limited to that job and the opportunities it provides. however, if they try something new, they may find a better job or discover a new skill that can open up entirely new possibilities. finally, trying new things and taking risks can also lead to personal growth and development. by pushing oneself outside their comfort zone, they can develop new skills and abilities that can help them in the future. they may also gain confidence and self esteem by overcoming their fear of the unknown. in conclusion, trying new things and taking risks can lead to success. this is because it opens up more opportunities, and can also lead to personal growth and development. successful people understand the importance of these activities and are willing to take the risks associated with them.",0,0,0.0002912861215312633

"in the article the challenge of exploring venus, the author argues that studying venus is worth the danger it presents. the author supports this idea by providing examples of the difficulties in exploring venus and the benefits of doing so. the author explains that venus is a challenging planet to explore due to its harsh environment. the planet's thick atmosphere, extreme heat, and pressure make it difficult to send probes and rovers to its surface. the author also mentions that venus's surface is covered in volcanic rocks and has no signs of water, making it an inhospitable environment for humans. despite these challenges, the author argues that exploring venus is still a worthy pursuit. the planet's proximity to earth, similar size, and composition make it an ideal candidate for studying planetary formation and evolution. additionally, studying venus's atmosphere could provide insights into climate change and the greenhouse effect. the author supports this argument by citing recent missions to venus, such as the venus express and the pioneer venus missions. these missions have provided valuable data on venus's atmosphere, magnetic field, and geology. the author also mentions future missions, such as the proposed venus mobile explorer, which could provide even more detailed information about the planet. overall, the author effectively supports the idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. by providing examples of the challenges and benefits of exploring venus, the author makes a compelling case for continued research and exploration of the planet. in conclusion, the author's argument that studying venus is a worthy pursuit is well supported by evidence from the article. despite the dangers and difficulties in exploring the planet, the potential benefits make it an important area of research for scientists. by continuing to study venus, we can gain valuable insights into our own planet and the universe as a whole.",0,0,0.00010929427210978757
"phones and driving over the years, phones and other technology have taken over the lives of society. they have become a major necessity to society. people go everywhere with them and it often feels as though you've lost a child of you don't have it with you. although phones are of great use to every human being there are also a major drawback. people do not know how to discipline themselves to put away their phones, especially while they're driving in a vehicle. drivers should not be able to use their cellphones while driving. on any given day, about 660,000 americans will attempt to use their phones while in a vehicle according to ffc. according to cdc, texting and driving caused a whopping nine deaths and over 500 injuries in the year of 2018. one out of four car crashes are caused by texting and driving. many studies have shown that texting while driving doubles the chance of getting into an accident. the obsession of phones have caused way too many casualties than needed. many laws have been established to prevent the rise of deaths caused by texting and driving. about sixteen states including the u.s. ban all hand held cell phone use , while others have placed restrictions regarding cell phones. some states like, connecticut, georgia , new jersey, and maryland have placed penalties or fines for people that are texting while driving. these laws and penalties have shown to be pretty effective, the rates of casualties due to cell phone use have gone down tremendously. people in this society should also research ways to help them prevent the usage of the phones while driving. people all over the world should take their lives more seriously. answering a text, taking a video for snapchat, whatever the case may be should not be the cause of their fatal death. works cited bennett, lauren. 10 terrifying facts about texting and driving 2018 . teensafe. 100 distracted driving facts statistics 5. apr. 2018 facts statistics about texting driving, melinda j. helbock a.p.c , 2019, 2019 texting and driving statistics, miller zois, llc federal communications commission. the dangers of distracted driving 2019",1,1,0.9963377327120334

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular vote. as you know, the electoral college is a system in which each state is allocated a number of electors equal to its number of senators and representatives in congress. the candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives all of that state's electoral votes, with the exception of maine and nebraska, which award their electoral votes by congressional district. the candidate who wins a majority of the electoral votes 270 becomes president. there are a number of reasons why i believe the electoral college is an outdated and undemocratic system. first, it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election. this has happened five times in american history, most recently in 2016 when hillary clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes but lost the election to donald trump. this is because the electoral college gives more power to voters in less populous states. for example, a voter in wyoming has three times as much voting power as a voter in california. second, the electoral college encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a handful of battleground states where the outcome of the election is uncertain. this means that candidates often ignore the concerns of voters in other states, which can lead to a feeling of disenfranchisement among those voters. third, the electoral college is not a necessary safeguard against tyranny of the majority. the united states already has a number of checks and balances in place to protect minority rights, such as the senate and the supreme court. in conclusion, i believe that the electoral college is an outdated and undemocratic system that should be abolished. i urge you to support a constitutional amendment that would elect the president by popular vote. thank you for your time and consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.01024230207013157
"students should not be allowed to graduate early. it is better to stay in school for an additional year as it provides more opportunities for learning and career exploration. the fourth year of high school allows students to take more classes and learn at their own pace. it also gives them more time to discover their interests and pursue potential career paths. students who complete their fourth year of high school have access to a wider range of electives and courses that can help them make informed decisions about their future. they can take advantage of opportunities such as internships, apprenticeships, and volunteer work to gain valuable experience and knowledge. this experience can be invaluable when it comes to applying for college or entering the workforce. additionally, students who complete their fourth year of high school may be less stressed out as they have more time to manage their workload and prioritize their responsibilities. they can also take advantage of resources such as academic counseling and tutoring to help them succeed in their classes. it is important to remember that college is not the only pathway to success. many students may choose to pursue a gap year or attend a vocational school to gain practical experience and skills in their chosen field. completing their fourth year of high school provides students with the opportunity to explore these options and make informed decisions about their future. in conclusion, students should not be allowed to graduate early. the fourth year of high school provides more opportunities for learning, career exploration, and personal growth. it is important for students to take advantage of these opportunities and make informed decisions about their future.",0,0,3.9120793876117535e-06
"the electoral college a system worth saving dear state representative, i am writing to you today to voice my support of the electoral college. as a high school student in 9th grade, i have studied the history and purpose of this system of electing the president of the united states. although there are criticisms of its undemocratic nature and the possibility of discrepancies between the popular vote and electoral vote, i believe there are practical benefits to this system that should be upheld. the electoral college allocates electors based on state representation in congress, with almost all states using a winner take all approach. this system ensures that the president represents the entire country and has a broad appeal beyond just the most populous states. it also ensures certainty of the outcome, as there is no need for run off elections or recounts. furthermore, the electoral college forces candidates to focus their efforts on swing states, as they have greater influence in the outcome of the election. this helps to balance the influence of large states, which would otherwise dominate the election. despite criticisms of the undemocratic nature of the electoral college, the system is designed to protect the interests of small states and ensure that all americans have a voice in the election. without the electoral college, candidates could focus solely on heavily populated areas or swing states, ignoring the concerns and interests of other parts of the country. this could lead to voter disenfranchisement in states dominated by a single party, as they would have little influence in the election process. moreover, the electoral college provides stability and consistency in the representative democratic process of the united states. while it may not always align with the popular vote, the electoral college has been a consistent factor in the election process for centuries. it ensures that every voice is heard and that the president represents the entire country, not just a few densely populated areas. in conclusion, while there are criticisms of the electoral college, i believe it remains a vital component of electing the president of the united states. it ensures a broad appeal, balances the influence of large states, and provides stability in the election process. i urge you to support the electoral college and uphold its role in our democratic system. sincerely, a concerned student.",0,0,0.0006190166223297062

"when it comes to creative endeavors, there is no better outlet than music. music can bring joy and comfort in times of sorrow, lift us up when our spirits are low, and provide a medium for self expression like no other. whether one is a master musician or just tinkering around on an instrument for fun, the act of making music has many profound benefits. one of those benefits is the way that it can help improve mental health. playing an instrument releases dopamine into the brain which helps reduce stress levels while also giving one a feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction. research suggests that musicians may even be at an advantage over nonmusicians when it comes to problem solving as musical training requires practice with complex patterns and abstract thinking skills used by mathematicians and scientists alike such as working out spatial relationships. additionally, research has shown that learning to play certain instruments such as guitar actually leads to increased cognitive function in both children and adults!. as if these psychological benefits weren't enough reason alone to pick up playing music, there's also the social aspect involved which cannot be overlooked either. from bands made up entirely of close friends to jamming with strangers at open mic nights, making music together gives people opportunities for collaboration unlike any other kind of activity out there offering individuals experiences in teamwork building not available from traditional team sports or group activities elsewhere yet still providing great enjoyment all the same!. . the art of creating something beautiful from seemingly nothing is powerful beyond words allowing each individual who participates in this craft access into different parts within themselves they never knew existed before. so don t wait another moment grab your favourite instrument today and start exploring what you have been missing out on!",0,0,0.005076871322306347

"dear senator, i am writing to share my perspective on how americans elect the president. after reviewing arguments for and against the current electoral college system versus a popular vote, i believe transitioning to a national popular vote would better uphold democratic principles. the electoral college was designed to safeguard the interests of smaller states, but it can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. this has occurred a few times throughout history and erodes faith in our system. a popular vote would establish a clearer standard of one person, one vote without state by state distortions. it would also motivate candidates to campaign and earn votes from a broader range of citizens across red and blue states alike. i understand concerns that a pure popular vote could lead candidates to focus only on population centers. however, the current system also incentivizes candidates to ignore several states that are deemed non competitive. a national popular vote may slightly shift campaign strategies, but it would encourage earning support from all americans rather than select regions. furthermore, campaigning based on total votes nationwide seems more aligned with democratic values than targeting a few swing states under our electoral college system. while no system is perfect, transitioning to a national popular vote could strengthen civic participation and assure that every vote, in every state, matters equally in electing the president. it would make clear that the candidate who receives the most votes wins, consistent with how we decide most other elections in this country. for these reasons, i believe changing to a popular vote merits serious consideration as a way to modernize how we select our highest elected leader. please support reforming this important aspect of our democracy. thank you for your time and public service. i am happy to discuss this issue further. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.0010185752679630704

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president by popular vote. i believe that this is the only way to ensure that the president is truly chosen by the people. the electoral college is a relic of the past. it was created in 1787 at a time when the united states was a very different country. the founding fathers were concerned that a direct election of the president would give too much power to the large states. they wanted to ensure that all states, regardless of size, had a voice in the election. but the world has changed since 1787. the united states is now a much larger and more diverse country. the electoral college is no longer necessary to protect the interests of small states. in fact, it actually works against the interests of many small states. in order to win the presidency, a candidate needs to win the electoral college. this means that they need to win a majority of the electoral votes. but the number of electoral votes that a state has is not proportional to its population. for example, wyoming has three electoral votes, even though it has a population of only 577,737 people. california, on the other hand, has 55 electoral votes, even though it has a population of over 39 million people. this means that a candidate can win the popular vote, but still lose the election. this has happened five times in american history, most recently in 2016. in that election, hillary clinton won the popular vote by over 3 million votes, but donald trump won the presidency because he won more electoral votes. this is not fair. it is not democratic. and it is not representative of the will of the people. the only way to fix this problem is to abolish the electoral college and elect the president by popular vote. this would ensure that the president is truly chosen by the people of the united states. i urge you to support this important reform. than you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.004293827715539769
"have you ever wanted to go outer space? well i have, but what this excellent passage is telling me about venus is making me change my mind. i never knew how dangerous the solar system was until i read this passage about the earth's twin venus. the author that wrote this passage had very good support to support his passage over venus. the author told us about how venus is very dangerous but is a very interesting planet to study. also, he told us about how about the features and the history about venus. the author sports the idea that venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers that venus have. the author supports the idea very well because he added facts. also, he did very well with supporting his claim because he has good look passages. also he states that, also rotatable, venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though mercury is closest to the sun . so this means that venus is dangerous even if you go to it is too hot to even step foot on. in conclusion, studying venus is a worthy pursuit because you can find a lot of facts and statistics about venus. the author states that venus, sometimes called the evening star, is one of the the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer. so, this mean venus isn't just a planet it also is an evening star. i have gone through all the evidence that the author excellently supports his idea.",1,1,0.9985081515425184
"while some believe the face on mars was carved by aliens, scientific evidence clearly shows it is a natural landform formed through erosion over time. bhe article unmasking the face on mars provides compelling details that support this conclusion. one of the key claims made in the article is that the face lacks distinctive features one would expect from an artificial structure, such as well defined edges or symmetry. upon closer examination, its eyes, nose and mouth are irregularly shaped and spread across an uneven slope. this variation is characteristic of wind and water erosion gradually wearing down a mesa over millions of years. in contrast, an intelligently designed sculpture would likely have clearer, more precisely chiseled details. additional evidence presented shows how climate changes on mars have contributed to the landform's appearance. bhe article notes that carbon dioxide frozen in the polar caps seasonally thaws and sublimates, leaving myriad gullies and dried river beds below. water erosion from these seasonal flows further weathered softer rock layers, slowly etching out darker shapes against the lighter stone. over vast expanses of geologic time, even random actions of natural forces could conspire to depict parabolic images like a human face. in conclusion, while the face on mars briefly captured our imagination with its peculiar likeness, scientific investigation has rightfully unmasked it as a product of nature, not aliens. bhe irregularities in its shape and geology, coupled with evidence of phenomena like erosion, make a compelling case this is simply a misperceived martian mesa. sometimes a face is just a face, formed by natural rather than otherworldly means. for these reasons, the scientific consensus remains that mars has shown us nothing more than its own bare surfaces.",0,0,0.001548501877562065
"in the past few decades, car culture has become increasingly prevalent in the united states. this has led to a number of problems, including traffic congestion, air pollution, and urban sprawl. in recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in order to address these problems. there are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. first, it can help to reduce traffic congestion. when people drive less, there are fewer cars on the road, which can lead to faster and more efficient travel times. second, limiting car usage can help to improve air quality. cars are a major source of air pollution, so reducing the number of cars on the road can lead to cleaner air. third, limiting car usage can help to reduce urban sprawl. when people drive less, they are more likely to live in or near urban centers. this can help to reduce the amount of land that is used for roads and parking lots. there are a number of ways to limit car usage. one way is to make it more expensive to drive. this can be done by increasing the price of gas or by charging tolls on highways. another way to limit car usage is to make it easier to walk, bike, or take public transportation. this can be done by building more sidewalks and bike lanes, or by providing better public transportation options. limiting car usage is a difficult task, but it is one that is worth undertaking. the benefits of limiting car usage are numerous, and they include reduced traffic congestion, improved air quality, and reduced urban sprawl. in order to limit car usage, we need to make it more expensive to drive and make it easier to walk, bike, or take public transportation. together, we can make our communities more livable and sustainable. in addition to the environmental and economic benefits of limiting car usage, there are also a number of social benefits. when people drive less, they are more likely to interact with their neighbors and build stronger communities. they are also more likely to get exercise, which can improve their physical and mental health. limiting car usage is a win win for everyone. it is good for the environment, the economy, and our communities. we should all do our part to reduce car usage and make our world a better place.",0,0,2.8832296504209238e-05
"title the future of transportation driverless cars introduction imagine a world where cars drive themselves, reducing accidents, saving time, and providing more opportunities for people with disabilities to travel independently. this future is not far off, as the concept of driverless cars is becoming increasingly realistic, thanks to advances in technology. main points 1. safety one of the main advantages of autonomous vehicles is their enhanced safety features. with the help of sensors, cameras, and advanced software, these cars can detect and respond to obstacles much quicker than human drivers. they are designed to reduce the chances of human errors and collisions, which could lead to fewer accidents on the roads. 2. efficiency automated vehicles have the potential to optimize traffic flow by communicating with each other and adjusting their speed to maintain a consistent flow. this would result in less congestion, shorter commutes, and reduced fuel consumption. 3. accessibility self driving cars have the potential to revolutionize travel for individuals with disabilities, elderly people, and those who cannot drive. they would be able to access transportation without relying on others, providing more independence and freedom. 4. environmental benefits as autonomous cars become more prevalent, there could be a significant decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, due to reduced idling, improved fuel efficiency, and smoother traffic flow. this would ultimately help to combat climate change and improve air quality. 5. jobs and the economy the widespread adoption of self driving cars could lead to a shift in job opportunities, with a greater demand for engineers, software developers, and other professionals who specialize in the technology behind autonomous vehicles. this could potentially boost the economy by creating new job opportunities and encouraging innovation. conclusion in conclusion, the development and implementation of driverless cars have the capacity to significantly improve transportation and the lives of people around the world. as the technology continues to advance, we can look forward to safer, more efficient, and more accessible modes of travel.",0,0,0.00022803131521134497
studying venus is a worthy persuit despite its dangers. the author has a few reasons of why he thinks this. some of them are to find out what it is made up of. another one is to try and find out why there is no life on mars. also even though he thinks they should explore it he talks about the dangers and how really dangerous it is. there are a lot of risks to exploring venus but it would be worth it. one thing that the authro does well to support his idea is he gives a lot of compelling resons of why he thiks venus is worth exploring. one of the reasons why he things its worth exploring is because they can find out what venus is made up of by taking rock samples. i think this is a good reason becuase it explains how the author wants to explore venus despite its dangers. another reason why he thinks it should be explored despite its dangers is becuase they can figure out why there is no life on venus. i also think this is a good reason becuase it proves why venus should be explored even though it is dangerous according to the author. in conclusion the author has a good point of why venus should be explored despite the dangers. one of his reasons is to find out why there is no life on venus. another reason is to find out what venus is made up of. i think these are good supporting reasons because they prove why venus should be explored even though it has dangers.,1,1,0.9840942111115751

"dear principal, well, since the school principal is deciding whether or not to raise the grade average for sports is actually good. although many students have a grade c average, i would say that if they were to put as much effort as they do in their sports, yes, it would be a good decision. that is if the students that are on the sports team want to be on the team that bad. despite all the anger that may rage through all of the student body, i have met people who do sports and maintain a straight a average. so in saying, it is never all that hard to maintain a higher grade average, as long as you have the time, to do both, the time management, and mainly, the skills to do any of it. as long as you have all of those things, then you don't have to worry about much. i'm stating that, if students currently have a grade c average, then they should be able to put that extra work into it for their own benefit, not the benefit of the school. realizing all that could be done with such a step forward, if this were to go to let's say, all public schools, then there would be students that would walk that extra mile. if students would decide they really want something, just think on how much the national report card would rise. everything involving school would be effected in a good way. despite all of the controversy that may rise throughout the student body, it's for their own benefit, and for the nation's benefit as well. so my answer is, yes, this would be a good idea. though i would suggest the schools rise the average slowly, such as c c b. in that type of way, so the students would be able to accept what is happening more clearly. this would be a huge benefit in almost everything, ranging from the stock market to the nation. this would also call for more responsibility, and overall, more genius flowing through the veins of this nation.",1,1,0.9995605908509942

"when faced with an important decision, it is wise to gather information and perspectives from different sources. no single person can possible have all the answers or consider every angle of a complex situation. by talking to multiple trusted friends, family members, or professionals, one increases the chances of obtaining a well rounded understanding. each person one talks to brings a unique background and viewpoint. for example, if deciding between career paths, consulting both a mentor in the desired field and someone in an alternate industry can provide complementary insight. the mentor focused on that work understands it thoroughly get may take some aspects for granted, while the outsider sees things less familiarly but with fresher eyes. differing viewpoints also help avoid tunnel vision or preconceptions clouding one's judgment. discussing major decisions with others prevents relying too heavily on a single source who shares the same inherent biases. multiple advisors each highlight factors the decision maker might have overlooked on their own. their questions and considerations prompt reexamination from new angles. finally, comparing the advice received and weighing the pros and cons highlighted by various counselors facilitates a more deliberate, fullqinformed choice. pulling information from a wide pool reduces the chances of being misled or making a rash decision based on incomplete data. while ultimately one must decide alone, increasing the breadth of input from trusted individuals improves the chances of selecting the optimal path. in summary, seeking multiple opinions provides more complete data and a well rounded perspective to support complex decision making. no single person contains all understanding, so widening consultations reduces blind spots and errors in judgment. weighing varied viewpoints helps make choices with open and clear sighted care.",0,0,0.007861881513076652
"the face on mars is a mysterious and captivating feature that has intrigued scientists, astronomers, and the public alike. this formation, located on the martian surface, is a mesa known as the cydonia mensae region. the face like structure, which resembles the profile of a humanoid, was discovered by nasa in the 1970s. the face measures approximately 1.2 miles across, and its distinct features have led to numerous theories and speculations about its origin and purpose. some people believe that this structure was created by intelligent extraterrestrial life, while others argue that it could be a natural formation or even a trick of light and shadows on the martian surface. scientists continue to study this enigma, utilizing high resolution images and sophisticated data analysis techniques to gain insights into the nature of the face on mars. one of the most popular theories suggests that the formation is the result of erosion and weathering processes over millions of years. this theory suggests that the rock layers in the region were subjected to wind and water erosion, which eventually formed the distinct features resembling a face. despite these efforts, there is still no definitive explanation for the face on mars. as our understanding of the martian surface continues to evolve, we may eventually find the answer to this fascinating puzzle. in the meantime, the face remains one of the most intriguing mysteries of our solar system, sparking our imagination and inspiring further exploration of our neighboring planet.",0,0,3.048560651319403e-05

"dear principal smith, i am writing to express my views on the possible policy change that would require students to have at least a b average in order to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities. while maintaining good grades is important, i do not think raising the minimum gpa requirement from a c to a b is the best approach. there are a few key reasons why i am against making this change first, for many students, participating in sports and clubs is what motivates them to work hard in their classes. being able to balance academic responsibilities with extracurricular passions helps students stay engaged and boosts their overall well being. taking away that outlet could negatively impact students' grades instead of improving them. second, a c average already shows that students are passing their classes and making satisfactory progress. while encouraging higher achievement is worthwhile, a b average is quite high and would exclude many students who are doing acceptably well but need more time to reach an advanced level. this could disproportionately impact students with learning differences or those jugging jobs and family responsibilities alongside school. finally, participation in sports, music, and other groups is invaluable for students' social and leadership development. it helps them learn teamwork, time management, and other skills that will serve them well beyond the classroom. unless a student is truly struggling academically, these benefits should not be denied. for these reasons, i believe the current c average policy strikes the right balance of accountability and opportunity. students work hard to maintain eligible grades while still having healthy outlets. raising the bar could undermine motivation andexcludedeservingstudents. i hope you will reconsider this proposed change after considering students' perspectives. please let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of these points. thank you for your time and consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.0016146642080675504
"dear senator, i am writing to express my biw that the united states should change from the current electoral college system to instead elect the president by a popular national both. while the electoral college was devised with the aim of gibing smaller states more influence, i bqliqbq it no longer adequately serbs that purpose and creates disadvantages that outweigh its merits. on argument often made in favor of keeping the electoral college is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and avoid focusing only on population centers. however, research shows that candidates already focus their efforts only on swing states under the current system. this means voters in dozens of noncompetitive states arq essentially ignored during campaigns. electing by popular both could encourage candidates to campaign across the entire nation and appeal to a broader range of americans. it is also argued that the electoral college protects the interests of small states. but according to census data, population has dramatically shifted since the system was established, and now just a handful of states rqcqibq disproportionate attention. a popular both would gibe query both equal weight regardless of what state someone lies in. this aligns more closely with the democratic principle of on person, on both. a further counterargument is that without the electoral college, presidential candidates might win with just a plurality of bots rather than a majority. however, there arq alternative electoral methods like ranked choice voting that could help ensure a majority is still achieved through additional rounds of counting. overall, a national popular both sqq ms simpler, fairer and more consistent with americans shared democratic values of equal representation. for this reasons, i bqliqbq changing to a national popular both system would address flaws in the current electoral college approach and better serb the interests of all citizens across states. i hope you will consider supporting reforms to mob in this direction. the presidency should by determined by who americans collectively choose as their leader.",0,0,0.001764329573839947

"seeking multiple opinions when making an important choice can help one make a better, well rounded decision. there are several reasons for this different perspectives. discussing a problem or decision with more than one person exposes you to a variety of viewpoints. while friends and family may share similar backgrounds, they each have had unique experiences that shape their perspectives. getting input from multiple individuals allows you to consider angles you may not have thought of otherwise. this helps provide a more complete picture to evaluate different options against. identifying blind spots. when troubled with a decision, it's easy to fixate on only certain factors that may support the choice you're currently leaning towards. consulting others helps bring to light considerations you could be overlooking or dismissing too quickly due to implicit biases. people removed from the direct situation may spot subtle but important consequences or implications you failed to foresee. getting feedback helps correct blind spots in your own reasoning. testing the strength of reasons. presenting your thoughts and rationale to multiple people acts as a test of how robust the reasoning is behind a given option. opinions that withstand questioning and critique from divergent minds are likely based on sounder logical foundations. potential weaknesses or flaws in the arguments of a less viable choice may be exposed through this process, pointing more clearly to the alternative best supported by facts. back up opinions. major decisions often involve an element of risk. if things don't work out as planned with the choice you make, having the support of others you consulted can soften the blow of disappointment. knowing there were equally qualified people who felt your decision was a good one based on the same information available at the time will help reassure you that any unintended outcome was not due simply to a defect in your resolution skills. the confidence from multiple endorsements can make facing difficult consequences easier. considering alternative perspectives can strengthen the pillars upon which a significant choice is built. the fusion of diverse viewpoints, examined rationally, results in wiser judgement less likely to regret. while any final decision rests with the individual, leveraging outside insight multiplies the quality of the conclusion reached.",0,0,0.03134368297375826

"banning singles plastics a necessary step towards environmental conservation single use plastics have become a major concern for the environment, anj the debate on whether to ban them or not has intensified in recent times. i strongly believe that banning single use plastics is a necessary step towards environmental conservation. in this essay, i will provide reasons anj examples to support my position. firstly, single use plastics are nonbiodegradable, meaning that they take hundreds of years to decompose. this leads to plastic waste accumulating in landfills anj oceans, causing harm to wildlife anj marine life. for instance, plastic bags anj straws that end up in the ocean can harm sea turtles anj other marine creatures by choking them or blocking their digestive systems. banning single use plastics can reduce this harm significantly. secondly, the production anj disposal of single use plastics contribute to greenhouse gas emissions anj global warming. the process of manufacturing single use plastics requires large amounts of energy anj resources, which leads to carbon emissions. additionally, the disposal of these plastics in landfills produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. by banning single use plastics, we can reduce the production of these harmful gases. finally, banning single use plastics can encourage people to adopt more environmentally friendly alternatives. for example, instead of using plastic bags, we can use reusable cloth bags or paper bags. this can reduce the amount of plastic waste generate anj promote sustainable living. in conclusion, banning single use plastics is crucial for the wellbeing of our environment. it can help reduce the harm cause by plastic waste to wildlife anj marine life, decrease greenhouse gas emissions anj global warming, anj promote sustainable living. therefore, i urge policymakers anj individuals to support this initiative anj take steps towards reducing the use of single use plastics.",0,0,9.325418318204322e-07

"in the past, nasa's viking 1 spacecraft captured an interesting photo of a martian mesa in cydonia, which was perceived as a face. this photo sparked intrigue among scientists as well as the public. it became famous in films and media and fueled conspiracy theories about the possibility of alien life on mars. nasa prioritized photographing cydonia with the mars global surveyor in 1997, hoping to find evidence to support the theory about alien presence. however, the results of the imaging revealed that the so called face of mars was, in fact, just a natural landform, similar to earth's buttes or mesas. this discovery disappointed those hoping for proof that there is indeed life on mars. the laser altimetry confirmed this, as it showed that cydonia's landforms are similar to the rest of the planet's geological features. despite this, cydonia holds a unique position as a potential ancient ocean boundary, which raises interesting questions about mars' past geological history. in conclusion, while the face on mars has long captured our imagination and sparked debates among scientists and the public, nasa's findings confirm the face is just a natural landform, not a structure created by an alien civilization. while this may be disappointing for some, the discovery still holds valuable geological and scientific value.",0,0,0.003775388180677632
"venus is a fascinating planet, often referred to as earth's sister planet due to their similar size and mass. however, there are many distinct differences between earth and venus which make them unique celestial bodies. venus has been explored extensively by spacecraft missions, and scientists have learned much about its geology, atmosphere, and potential for life. one of the most striking features of venus is its extreme surface temperature and atmospheric pressure. temperatures reach up to 464 degrees celsius, which is hot enough to melt lead. this is due to an incredibly thick atmosphere composed of 96 carbon dioxide. the atmosphere is responsible for creating a runaway greenhouse effect, which leads to a constant cloud cover and high surface temperatures. in the past, venus was believed to have a more earth like environment, but as more data was gathered, scientists discovered that the planet's surface is actually covered with solidified lava. this means that venus likely underwent a major transformation in its history. venus' thick atmosphere has made it difficult to explore its surface directly, but several missions, such as the soviet venera missions in the 1970s and 1980s, have landed on the planet and sent back valuable data. the european space agency's venus express spacecraft, launched in 2005, studied the planet from orbit for over eight years. the japanese akatsuki orbiter arrived at venus in 2015 and began conducting detailed observations. in addition to these missions, nasa is currently planning a mission to venus called the veritas venus emissivity, radio science, insar, topography and spectroscopy mission, which is set to launch in the 2030s. veritas will study the planet's surface and atmosphere, providing crucial information about its geological history and potential for supporting life. venus remains an enigma in our solar system, with many mysteries yet to be unraveled. its extreme conditions and potential for harboring life make it a subject of great interest to scientists and space enthusiasts. as technology continues to advance, we can expect more exploration missions to be sent to our sister planet, helping us better understand its unique and fascinating characteristics.",0,0,0.005523122223746241

"i think that summer projects should be student designed. it's important for students to have the opportunity to take ownership of their learning and have a say in what they want to explore. when students are able to design their own projects, they are more likely to be engaged and motivated to learn. for example, if a student is interested in photography, they could design a project where they take pictures of different landmarks in their community and learn about the history behind them. this way, they are learning about history, art, and photography all at the same time. on the other hand, if a teacher designs the project, it might not be as engaging for the student. the student might not have a personal interest in the topic, and they might feel like they are just doing busy work. this could lead to a negative experience and a lack of motivation to learn. additionally, student designed projects allow for more creativity and critical thinking. when students are given the freedom to come up with their own ideas, they have to think critically about what they want to learn and how they want to go about it. this helps them develop problem solving skills and independence, which are important qualities to have in life. of course, it's important for teachers to provide guidance and support throughout the process. they can help students brainstorm ideas, provide resources, and give feedback on their progress. but ultimately, the student should have the freedom to design their own project and take ownership of their learning. in conclusion, student designed summer projects are the way to go. they allow for student engagement, creativity, critical thinking, and ownership of learning. by giving students the freedom to design their own projects, we are preparing them for a future where they will need to be independent and self motivated learners.",0,0,0.0006244006734358903

"dear principal, i strongly believe that changing the current policy to require a b average for participation in sports and school activities is a positive step towards promoting academic excellence among students. while some may argue that maintaining a c average is sufficient, i believe that a b average is a more realistic and achievable goal for most students. firstly, many students struggle to maintain a c average, especially if they are involved in extracurricular activities such as sports. this can lead to a decline in their grades, which can negatively impact their overall academic performance. by requiring a b average, we can ensure that students are focusing on their school work and not neglecting their grades in favor of their extracurricular activities. secondly, maintaining a b average is a realistic goal for most students. while some may argue that they are smart enough to maintain a c average, it is important to remember that academic success is not solely based on innate intelligence. rather, it is a combination of hard work, dedication, and discipline. by requiring a b average, we can encourage students to work harder and prioritize their academic success. thirdly, maintaining a b average can have a positive impact on a student's self esteem and confidence. by achieving a higher grade, students will feel a sense of accomplishment and pride in their academic achievements. this can lead to increased motivation and a desire to continue working hard towards their goals. in conclusion, i strongly believe that changing the current policy to require a b average for participation in sports and school activities is a positive step towards promoting academic excellence among students. by encouraging students to focus on their school work, maintain a realistic goal, and improve their self esteem, we can help them achieve their full potential and become successful members of society. sincerely, your name",0,0,1.0530979050374495e-06

"introduction as a scientist at nasa, i've had the opportunity to study the face on mars, a fascinating geological formation that has sparked intense curiosity and speculation. while some believe it was created by aliens, i'm here to argue that the face is, in fact, a natural landform. body firstly, let's examine the evidence. the mars global surveyor, which imaged cydonia in 1997, revealed that the face is a natural landform, similar to earth's buttes or mesas. this information is supported by laser altimetry, which confirmed its natural origins. the face is not unique it's one of many mesas in the cydonian region, all with similar geological features. furthermore, the location of the face is significant. it lies at a potential ancient martian ocean boundary, making it an intriguing geological feature worthy of scientific study. the possibility of an ancient ocean on mars raises questions about the planet's past, and the face provides valuable insights into this mysterious period. another critical point to consider is the lack of evidence supporting the existence of alien life on mars. despite decades of exploration, we have yet to find conclusive proof of extraterrestrial life. it's important to base our conclusions on verifiable data, rather than speculation or imagination. finally, it's essential to recognize that the face on mars has been an important cultural icon, inspiring films, books, and art. while it's understandable that people want to believe in the existence of alien life, it's crucial to separate fact from fiction. we must be mindful of the potential impact of spreading misinformation and the importance of accuracy in scientific inquiry. conclusion in conclusion, the face on mars is not a creation of aliens, but a natural landform that offers valuable insights into the geological history of the red planet. the evidence supports this claim, and it's essential to rely on verifiable data when forming conclusions about the world around us. i hope this argument has convinced you that the face on mars is an intriguing, yet natural, geological formation.",0,0,0.0003812256600775297

"as the world becomes more globalized, the importance of learning english has become increasingly significant. however, when it comes to chinese learners, the question arises as to which skill of english is more important. while some people think that reading is more crucial, others believe that speaking takes priority. in my opinion, both skills are equally important, but it depends on the individual's needs and goals. firstly, reading is an essential skill that helps learners to improve their vocabulary, comprehension, and critical thinking abilities. it is especially important for those who are pursuing higher education or working in fields that require extensive reading, such as law or medicine. reading also exposes learners to different writing styles and genres, which can help them to develop their own writing skills. moreover, reading in english can provide learners with access to a vast amount of information and knowledge that is not available in their native language. on the other hand, speaking is equally important, especially for those who plan to live or work in english speaking countries. speaking fluently and accurately can help learners to communicate effectively with native speakers, which is essential in social and professional settings. it can also help learners to build confidence and improve their pronunciation, which can be challenging for chinese learners due to the differences in phonetics between chinese and english. in conclusion, both reading and speaking are essential skills that chinese learners need to develop to become proficient in english. however, the priority should depend on the individual's needs and goals. for those who are pursuing higher education or working in fields that require extensive reading, reading should be given priority. for those who plan to live or work in english speaking countries, speaking should be given priority. ultimately, mastering both skills will provide learners with the tools they need to succeed in today's globalized world.",0,0,2.6606660263047405e-07
"the issue of whether to abolish the current examination system for senior high school students is a controversial one. while some argue that it hinders students' creativity and all round development, others believe that it is necessary to ensure fairness and equality in the college admission process. in my opinion, the examination system should not be abolished completely, but rather reformed to better serve the needs of students. on the one hand, it is true that the current examination system has some negative effects on students. the emphasis on rote memorization and test taking skills often leads to a lack of creativity and critical thinking abilities. moreover, the pressure to perform well on exams can cause stress and anxiety, which can have a detrimental effect on students' mental health. these problems are particularly acute for students who are not naturally gifted in academics, as they may feel discouraged and demotivated by the constant focus on test scores. on the other hand, abolishing the examination system altogether would create new problems. without a standardized test, colleges would have to rely on other criteria to evaluate applicants, such as grades, extracurricular activities, and personal essays. this would inevitably lead to issues of privilege and discrimination, as students from wealthy families or prestigious schools would have an advantage over those from less privileged backgrounds. moreover, without a national entrance examination, it would be difficult to ensure that all colleges are admitting students who meet a certain level of academic achievement. therefore, i believe that the best solution is to reform the examination system to better reflect students' abilities and potential. this could involve reducing the emphasis on memorization and test taking skills, and instead focusing on critical thinking, problem solving, and creativity. additionally, the examination system could be supplemented by other forms of assessment, such as project based assignments or portfolios, which would allow students to showcase their skills and interests in a more holistic way. in conclusion, while the current examination system has it's flaws, abolishing it completely would create new problems. instead, we should work to reform the system to better serve the needs of students and ensure fairness and equality in the college admission process.",0,0,1.916090473208554e-06

"fashion is a form of self expression and can be used to establish an individual identity. it has the power to tell stories without words, allowing people to express themselves through clothing choices. by carefully selecting items from the vast array of apparel available, one can make a statement about their personality and beliefs that will have an impact on those around them. through fashion, culture is shared in ways both subtle and obvious. the way someone dresses not only speaks volumes about their personal style but also reveals aspects of who they are as a person what kind of music they like, their political affiliations and social trends that inform how they live. people use fashion to create unity with others who share similar values or interests for example, denim styles became popular among teens during the early 2000s due to its association with bands such as the strokes or franz ferdinand. throughout history there have been numerous instances where certain garments were used by groups of people to identify themselves punk rockers wearing tartan fabrics in 1970s london being just one example. even though many believe fashion should remain fluid and ever changing responding quickly enough when something new comes along some prefer staying true to classic silhouettes that never go out of style such as trench coats or little black dresses lbd . this allows individuals to keep up with current trends while still remaining recognizable within their chosen circle. moreover this type of timeless elegance prevents anyone from becoming too trend focused which results in overspending on clothes that will quickly become outdated once something else takes its place at the top spot amongst fashionable circles . at the end of day we all need clothes for practical reasons but there s no denying it's fun seeing how our wardrobe choices define us as individuals even if it sometimes means standing out from everyone else! fashion provides us with limitless opportunities for expressing ourselves in unique ways through clothing selections so why not take advantage? wear what you love no matter if it's trendy or timeless you",0,0,0.00020552644695258587

"while the technology represents a remarkable advancement, its current form leaves much to be desired. the article highlights several limitations of current driverless car technology. for instance, these cars are not yet capable of handling complex driving scenarios at higher speeds, and they still require human intervention and constant vigilance. this raises questions about their practicality and whether they are truly driverless. moreover, the focus on driverless cars diverts attention from refining existing technologies that could greatly improve road safety. furthermore, privacy concerns are a significant issue when it comes to driverless cars. to ensure driver engagement, some manufacturers are considering installing cameras to monitor drivers, which raises serious privacy concerns. the thought of being constantly watched and evaluated by a manufacturer is unsettling and could lead to increased stress and distracted driving. the economic implications of transitioning to driverless cars are also substantial. the vehicles require compatible infrastructure, such as 'smart roads' that can communicate with them, which would be exorbitantly expensive. additionally, these smart roads would need to be universally compatible with all types of vehicles, both driverless and traditional, adding to the financial burden. in conclusion, while the idea of driverless cars is intriguing, their current limitations, privacy concerns, and economic burden make them impractical for widespread adoption. therefore, i argue that refining existing technologies should be our current focus rather than pushing for a futuristic ideal that is not yet practical or beneficial to society.",0,0,1.1916229713257804e-05
"as our world becomes increasingly urbanized, the need for sustainable living becomes more pressing. vauban, an experimental district near freiburg, germany, offers a model for suburban living without reliance on cars. established in 2006, vauban prohibits street parking, driveways, and home garages. though car ownership is allowed, car parking is limited to large garages on the development's edge, costing 40,000 per space. as a result, 70 of vauban's families live without cars, and 57 sold their cars to move there. vauban's approach to sustainable living is a significant step towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions. the district's focus on smart planning emphasizes compact, accessible neighborhoods with amenities within walking distance. this approach aligns with efforts in the u.s. and europe to develop suburbs that favor public transport and walking. however, challenges remain in changing car centric attitudes and adapting urban planning regulations to support such sustainable living models. living without a car has numerous advantages. firstly, it reduces our reliance on fossil fuels, contributing to a cleaner environment. secondly, it promotes physical activity and healthier lifestyles, as residents walk or cycle to get around. additionally, it saves money on car expenses such as fuel, insurance, and maintenance. finally, it reduces traffic congestion, making neighborhoods safer and more pleasant. in conclusion, vauban's innovative approach to sustainable living offers a model for suburban development. its emphasis on smart planning, public transport, and walking offers numerous advantages for residents, including a cleaner environment, healthier lifestyles, and cost savings. though challenges remain in changing car centric attitudes and adapting urban planning regulations, vauban's success demonstrates the potential for sustainable living in suburbs.",0,0,6.443406737394914e-06
"the debate whether people choose their own character traits or are shaped by outside influences has raged on for centuries. on the one hand, many people believe that individual character is predetermined and largely shaped by factors such as family upbringing, education, economic status, and other societal influences. on the other hand, those who hold that people fan choose their own character traits point to free will and personal choice as the deciding factors. regardless of which side of the debate you end up on, one thing is certain the interplay between the environment and the individual is complex and shaped by a multitude of factors. genetics, family, society, and culture are all powerful factors in shaping a person's character, and some researchers have taken these factors into amount in their studies. however, it is also true that people fan make conscious choices that affect the development of their character therefore, choice also plays a role in the overall formation of one's character. at the end of the day, whether people choose their own character traits or they are shaped by external influences is a complex question with no definitive answer. research has shown that both factors play a part in the development of character, and only by taking into amount both environmental and individual factors fan we fully understand the role each plays.",0,0,5.682694668166045e-05

"dear senator, i am writing to express my view that the united states should change from the electoral college system to electing the president by popular vote. while the electoral college was designed to give small states more influence, recent elections show that it can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. this undermines the principle of one person, one vote and legitimacy of presidential elections. supporters of the electoral college argue it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and avoid focusing just on a few populous states. however, in recent elections we have seen candidates focus their campaigning only in swing states that could vote either way. this leaves voters in many non competitive states feeling ignored. popular vote would encourage candidates to seek support from people in all states, not just a handful of swing states. it is also argued that without the electoral college, presidential candidates might ignore issues important to small states. however, candidates would still need to consider a wide range of issues to appeal to a national majority. moreover, smaller states still have equal representation in congress to advocate for their priorities. switching to a popular vote could increase voter turnout as more people would feel their ballots directly impact the outcome, and not just be symbolic votes in non competitive states. while the electoral college was designed to shield smaller states, it has not operated as intended and recent elections show it can undermine the one person, one vote principle. a national popular vote would make every vote equally important and encourage candidates to engage voters in all states. for these reasons, i believe changing to election by popular vote would strengthen our democratic system and the legitimacy of presidential elections. i hope you will consider supporting reform on this important issue.",0,0,0.0011779267893491205
"dear state senator, i think that electoral college is a great and fast way to gather up votes to pick on our new president but i think that it has some big issues and the neagtives overcome the positives. one of the great things electoral college brings that it is widely regarded as anarchronism with means that the votes wont be overruled it would acutally be the maguraty of the people voting on the president. if not it would be the elctors who elect the president, not the people. also the party the people select is highly trusted and rarely betrayed. there have been a lot of cases in the past that go against electoral college. one of the things that i am against the electoral college is that the voters dont actually vote on the presidental runner up they are actually voting on the state electors that who in turn elect the president. also most worrying is in the case of a tie in the electrical vote. in that special case the elctection would actually have to go to the house of representatives which means that state delegations vote on the president and the senate would choose the vice president. basically the electoral college is unfair to voters cause of the winner takes it all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning so they only focus on the tight swing states. its official in my opinion that the electoral college is unfair , outdated , lack of democratic pedigree and irrational. it has lack of reasons in favor. i think we should just get over with this and go old school and get done with all this confusing matter and change to election to popular votes it took more of time but it was more accurate and caused less problems. amazingly bob dole was right abolish the electoral college!",1,1,0.9834195356082391
"in the past two decades, we have seen a massive shift in the way people move around cities. in the 1990s, cars were the primary mode of transportation in most developed countries. today, however, cars are being used less and less, replaced by public transportation, bicycles, and walking. this trend is only going to continue in the next twenty years. there are several reasons for this. first, cars are becoming increasingly expensive. the cost of buying a car, as well as the cost of maintaining one, has been rising steadily for years. this is due to a number of factors, including the increasing price of oil and the fact that cars are getting more and more complex. as cars become more expensive, fewer people can afford to own one. second, cars are becoming less necessary. in the past, cars were the only way to get around in many places. today, however, there are often alternative methods of transportation, such as public transportation, bicycles, and walking. these alternatives are often cheaper and more convenient than cars. third, cars are becoming more dangerous. the number of car accidents and fatalities has been increasing for years. this is due to a number of factors, including distracted driving and the increasing number of cars on the road. as cars become more dangerous, fewer people want to use them. fourth, cars are becoming more polluting. cars produce a large amount of pollution, which is harmful to the environment. as the world becomes more aware of the need to protect the environment, fewer people want to use cars. in conclusion, there are many reasons why cars are being used less and less. this trend is only going to continue in the next twenty years.",0,0,0.003371662118732134
"the ability for students to attend classes remotely via online video conferencing can be both beneficial and detrimental. learning from home allows students to study and work simultaneously in an environment they are familiar and comfortable with, and eliminates the need to commute, potentially saving them time and money. on the other hand, there are potential distractions that can arise, such as family members or pets in the home, or students choosing to opt out of class and instead spend the time on their own activities. additionally, it can be more difficult to connect with the teacher and receive help from them, as limited guidance and direct feedback may be provided from a distance. ultimately, while there are both advantages and disadvantages associated with attending classes remotely, it is essential to consider each situation on an individual basis. ultimately, with the right mindset and dedication, remote learning can be a powerful tool for students, allowing them to master new skills and apply them to real life situations.",0,0,1.1915753078706844e-07

"venus, the second planet from the sun, has long fascinated astronomers and space enthusiasts due to its unique characteristics and intriguing mysteries. in this essay, we will explore some aspects of venus, including its geography, atmosphere, climate, and possible future missions. geography venus, often called earth's twin, is similar in size to our planet, but the similarities end there. venus has a thick atmosphere that is composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with a surface pressure 90 times that of earth's. this dense atmosphere creates a thick layer of cloud cover that obscures the planet's surface features. the planet's surface temperature can reach a scorching 864 degrees fahrenheit, which is hot enough to melt lead. atmosphere venus' atmosphere is primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen and sulfur dioxide. the thick atmosphere creates a greenhouse effect, trapping heat and contributing to the extreme temperatures on the planet's surface. climate venus has no seasons due to its tilt being almost perpendicular to the sun and its slow rotation. the surface of venus is constantly exposed to the sun, leading to extremely high temperatures. the atmosphere's composition and pressure contribute to the extreme conditions, making it impossible for life as we know it to exist on the planet. future missions scientists believe that studying venus can provide valuable information about the history of earth's atmosphere. venus may also offer insights into the potential habitability of exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars. in the future, missions to venus could include unmanned probes, orbiters, and possibly even manned missions, allowing humans to explore the planet firsthand. in conclusion, venus is an enigmatic planet with fascinating geological, atmospheric, and climatic features. as we continue to study venus, we may uncover new information about the history of our own planet and gain valuable insights into the search for extraterrestrial life. with ongoing advancements in technology and space exploration, missions to venus could provide us with a deeper understanding of our solar system and the possibilities beyond it.",0,0,0.004596909161977077

"state senator, the electoral college is outdated, and is commonly viewed as anachronism. in this system voters, instead of voting for a president, vote for a slate of electors. the slate of electors if chosen for the statewide election, would go to congress. at congress, they would then vote for the president. for many people, it seems understandably unfair. first off, voters cannot control who their electors vote for. at this point in time, voters have no more of a say in which president is elected they can only hope that the elected candidate shares the same views they do. most of the times, this is the wrong case. second off, many times voters will get confused in who they're voting for. they'll pick out a candidate without knowing much information about them, or what their views are. a random candidate will be chosen for their vote, and most times this tends to come to an unhappy ending. many times, voters will be disappointed and frustrated with how the election turns out. people claim this tends to be due to the electoral college. it would, in terms, be much simpler to change the election to go by popular vote. this would have many benefits on the difficulty of the systems selecting a president, to how people react. by choosing a popular vote, time of the election would be cut slimmer. people wouldn't have to focus on choosing an elector, or their worries that their state electors didn't share their views. it would give our people the chance to vote for the president they want. in the end, the electoral college should be abolished and thrown out. it doesn't make sense to keep continuing on this way, when the votes should be up to the people not random electors.",1,1,0.991842347673675

"standardized testing is an not topic in tee education world. while some people believe teat these tests are an accurate measure of student ability, others argue teat tea are not. in my opinion, standardized tests do not accurately measure a student's ability. tear are several reasons we i believe this to be true. firstly, standardized tests only measure a student's ability to take a test. tea do not take into account other important factors teat can impact a student's performance, such as tear some life, tear mental health, or tear learning style. for example, a student we struggles with anxiety may perform poorly on a standardized test, even if tea are very intelligent and capable of doing well in school. secondly, standardized tests often focus on a narrow range of skills and knowledge. tea do not provide a comprehensive picture of what a student knows and can do. for example, a student we is very talented in tee arts may not perform well on a standardized mate test, even if tea are very good at mate. finally, standardized tests can be biased against certain groups of students. for example, students we come from low income families or we speak english as a second language may struggle with standardized tests because tea are not familiar with tee language or tee cultural references teat are used in tee tests. in conclusion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability. tea only measure a student's ability to take a test, tea focus on a narrow range of skills and knowledge, and tea can be biased against certain groups of students. instead of relying on standardized tests, we should focus on other ways of assessing student learning, such as project based assessments, portfolios, and teacher observations. these methods provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of what a student knows and can do.",0,0,4.7584601475879706e-05

"while some believe the face on mars was carved by aliens, scientific evidence clearly shows it is a natural landform formed through erosion over time. the article unmasking the face on mars provides compelling details that support this conclusion. one of the key claims made in the article is that the face lacks distinctive features one would expect from an artificial structure, such as well defined edges or symmetry. upon closer examination, its eyes, nose and mouth are irregularly shaped and spread across an uneven slope. this variation is characteristic of wind and water erosion gradually wearing down a mesa over millions of years. in contrast, an intelligently designed sculpture would likely have clearer, more precisely chiseled details. additional evidence presented shows how climate changes on mars have contributed to the landform's appearance. the article notes that carbon dioxide frozen in the polar caps seasonally thaws and sublimates, leaving myriad gullies and dried river beds below. water erosion from these seasonal flows further weathered softer rock layers, slowly etching out darker shapes against the lighter stone. over vast expanses of geologic time, even random actions of natural forces could conspire to depict parabolic images like a human face. in conclusion, while the face on mars briefly captured our imagination with its peculiar likeness, scientific investigation has rightfully unmasked it as a product of nature, not aliens. the irregularities in its shape and geology, coupled with evidence of phenomena like erosion, make a compelling case this is simply a misperceived martian mesa. sometimes a face is just a face, formed by natural rather than otherworldly means. for these reasons, the scientific consensus remains that mars has shown us nothing more than its own bare surfaces.",0,0,0.002332953763634997

"distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, and with the ongoing pandemic, it has become a necessity for many students. while some may argue that distance learning has its drawbacks, there are several benefits that make it an excellent option for many students. first and foremost, distance learning allows students to learn at their own pace. in traditional classroom settings, students are often forced to keep up with the pace of their peers, which can be frustrating for those who need more time to understand the material. with distance learning, students can take the time they need to master each concept, without feeling pressure from their peers or teachers. another benefit of distance learning is that it allows students to learn in their own comfort zone. for students who are not socially adept or who had had bad experiences at school, the traditional classroom setting can be overwhelming and stressful. with distance learning, students can learn from the comfort of their own home, without the distractions and pressures of the classroom. distance learning also offers flexibility for students with busy schedules. many students had other commitments, such as part time jobs or family responsibilities, that make it difficult for them to attend traditional classes. with distance learning, students can complete their coursework at a time that works for them, without sacrificing their other responsibilities. finally, distance learning can be a great option for students who are looking for a more personalized learning experience. in traditional classroom settings, teachers are often unable to provide individualized attention to each student. with distance learning, teachers can spend more time working with each student, providing personalized feedback and support. in conclusion, there are several benefits to offering distance learning as an option for students. it allows students to learn at their own pace, learn in their own comfort zone, offers flexibility for students with busy schedules, and provides a more personalized learning experience. while distance learning may not be the best option for all students, it is an excellent choice for many who are looking for a more flexible and personalized learning experience.",0,0,2.4023798011927114e-06
"dear florida senator, i feel as if we, as florida citizens should be able to change election by popular votes rather than electoral college. i understand that the electoral college is a process that consists of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president and so forth but you don't understand how it is affecting the citizens. we are the people that vote! i am against the electoral college process because it overrides popular vote, voters aren't really voting for president, and the process is unfair to voters. to begin, i am against the electoral college process because it overrides popular vote. for example, in 2000 when al gore had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral votes, he lost the presidency. the popular votes are what really counts because it's the actual citizens voting not the electors. in contrast, the electoral college is a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. the electoral college process is forgetting that the popular votes is what really matters. furthermore, i am against the electoral college because voters aren't really voting for the president. for instance, if you lived in texas and wanted to vote for town kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry. the process isn't even trustworthy because the presidential candidates can elect themselves. under the electoral college process voters aren't voting for president but for the slate for electors. finally, i am against the electoral college because it's unfair to voters. for example, during the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't see the candidates at all. candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. this is unfair because voters should know who they are voting for. voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. in conclusion, the electoral college should not be used because it overrides popular votes and voters aren't really voting for the president. also, because electoral college is unfair to voters. like bob dole said, abolish the electoral college!",1,1,0.9390419637775052

"it's important for young students to consider the implications of committing to a career. while it may seem like a good idea to have a clear path in mind, the reality is that our interests and goals can change over time. if a young student commits to a career and then discovers that they don't enjoy it or find it difficult, they may have wasted their time and effort. additionally, if the classes required for the career are challenging and the student gives up halfway, their chances of achieving their goal may be diminished. on the other hand, some people may argue that it's a good idea for young students to commit to a career because they have a clear idea of what they want to do later in life. this can help them stay focused and motivated, and can also provide a sense of direction and purpose. however, it's important to remember that life is full of surprises and unexpected changes, and it's possible that a student's interests or circumstances may change. ultimately, it's up to each individual to decide whether or not to commit to a career at a young age. for those who are still exploring their options and unsure of their future, it may be wise to take a more flexible approach and keep an open mind. this can allow them to try out different careers and interests, and to make more informed decisions when the time comes to commit to a path.",0,0,1.1575154259044044e-05

"i believe that advertisements make products seem much better than the really are. there are a few reasons for this. first, advertisements are designed to create a desire in the viewer. the want you to want the product so that the can make money off of it. this is who ads often use catch phrases or images to get four attention. second, advertisements often use exaggerated claims to make the product seem better than it is. for example, a product might be advertised as being able to cure cancer, when in reality it might only be able to help reduce the symptoms. third, advertisements often use misleading images or statistics to make the product seem more effective than it is. for example, an advertisement might show a person who has used the product for a long time and looks health, when in reality the person is probably using a very small amount of the product and mar not even be using it correctly. finally, advertisements often use misleading claims about the cost or the time required to use the product. for example, an advertisement might sar that a product is east to use, when in reality it might require a lot of time and effort to use it correctly. all of these factors together make it very difficult to know what is really going on with the product.",0,0,0.012508126595917915
"standardized testing has been a controversial topic in schools for a long time. some people think that it is an accurate measure of student ability, while others believe that it is not. in my opinion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability because they do not take into account individual differences, they cause stress for students, and they do not reflect real life skills. firstly, standardized tests do not consider individual differences. every student is unique and learns at their own pace. some students may struggle with test taking, while others may excel at it. standardized tests do not allow for these differences and assume that all students learn the same way. for example, a student who is a great artist may not do well on a math test, but that does not mean they are not intelligent. standardized tests only measure a narrow range of skills and do not take into account the diverse talents and abilities of students. secondly, standardized tests cause stress for students. the pressure to perform well on these tests can be overwhelming for some students, and it can negatively impact their mental health. students may feel anxious, depressed, or even physically ill due to the stress of these tests. this stress can also affect their performance on the test, leading to inaccurate results. for example, a student who is normally a good test taker may freeze up during a standardized test due to the pressure. lastly, standardized tests do not reflect real life skills. in the real world, people are not judged solely on their ability to take tests. they are judged on their ability to problem solve, communicate, and work well with others. standardized tests do not measure these skills, and therefore, they do not accurately reflect a student's ability to succeed in life. for example, a student who does poorly on a standardized test may still excel in a career that requires creativity and critical thinking skills. in conclusion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability because they do not take into account individual differences, they cause stress for students, and they do not reflect real life skills. schools should consider alternative methods of assessment that take into account the diverse talents and abilities of their students. by doing so, they will provide a more accurate representation of a student's abilities and potential for success.",0,0,0.00011424059312842253
"the importance of a healthy lifestyle cannot be overstated. the benefits to having an active and well maintained lifestyle are numerous, from improved physical health to increased mental clarity. in order to achieve these positive results, it is necessary for individuals to take responsibility for their own actions by making conscious decisions about the foods they eat and regular exercise that they engage in. eating a balanced diet full of fresh fruits and vegetables is essential for maintaining good health. not only do whole foods provide important nutrients, but also help keep our blood sugars stable so we can avoid cravings and maintain energy throughout the day. foods high in saturated fat should be limited as much as possible due to their connection with increasing risk factors for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, etc. replacing them with more nutrient dense options such as whole grains, nuts seeds or legumes will promote better digestion while providing beneficial vitamins minerals that the body needs daily. in addition to nutrition being part of a healthy lifestyle physical activity is just as important when it comes to promoting wellness within ourselves. exercise helps reduce stress levels while improving cardiovascular strength endurance which supports work performance overall. whether one chooses walking jogging outside or engaging in exercises at home using lightweight equipment ie yoga mats , creating an individualized routine that feels right will motivate us more than something boring or repetitive ever could!. finally mindfulness practices are another great way of tapping into our inner wellbeing on any given day whether through meditation yoga classes offered online or simply taking 10 minutes out of your day for personal reflection time there s no wrong way when it comes honoring what works best for you personally! mindfulness teaches us how understanding ourselves leads naturally towards self love acceptance two very powerful tools when used correctly!. . overall living a life of balance between mind body spirit has its advantages both short term mental clarity long term lower risks associated with chronic",0,0,5.471772939828187e-05
"twenty five years ago a face was discovered on mars. nasa said that it was a rock that resembles a face. the rock had the look of eyes, nose, and a head. this is something that nasa and us scientist have never seen before. nasa hasn't figured out if it really is a face or just a rock. the face theory's do not make any since. the face has become an icon as it has made appearances in movies, books, and magazines. many scientists have thought that the cause of the face was because of aliens. then nasa wanted to figure out what it was, so they sent an orbiter camera. they found out that there was no alien resemblance at all. the face was very hard to find. as it states in the article the face on mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in april '98 a cloudy time of year page 8, unmasking the face on mars . it's not easy to target colonia, says gavin. in fact it's hard work page 9, gavin . the face was hard to detect and took a lot of work to figure out what it really is. scientist are still doing research on the face shaped rock. they are even sending spacecrafts with camera's to take pictures of the face. so far, they are not having any luck on getting a picture that isn't blurry. the face has become one of the most interesting and confusing things in science and still hasn't been solved today.",1,1,0.9788332342549044

"dear mr. johnson, i am writing to inform you that i have successfully taught a group of elementary school students the concepts of multiplying and dividing, as well as how these operations can pe used in real world situations. i have also explained why multiplying and dividing can solve problems faster than adding and subtracting, using examples. to begin, i started by introducing the students to the basic definitions of multiplying and dividing. i explained that multiplying is the process of combining two or more numbers to find a total, while dividing is the process of splitting a number into smaller parts to find a quotient and a remainder. i then provided the students with a few examples of multiplication and division problems, such as 3 x 4 12 and 20 5 4, to help them understand the concepts. next, i demonstrated how multiplying and dividing can pe used in real world situations. for example, if a bakery sells 10 loaves of spread for 5, and they want to know how much each loaf costs, they can divide the total cost by the number of loaves. alternatively, if a farmer has 20 cows and wants to know how much milk they produce in a week, they can multiply the number of cow spy the amount of milk each cow produces per day. finally, i explained why multiplying and dividing can solve problems faster than adding and subtracting. this is because multiplying and dividing involve repeating the same operation multiple times, which can pe done quickly and efficiently. for example, if a student needs to find the total cost of 10 items that cost 5 each, they can simply multiply 10 by 5, rather than adding 5 to itself 10 times. similarly, if a student needs to find the quotient and remainder when dividing 20 by 5, they can simply divide 20 by 5 and then use the remainder to find the quotient, rather than subtracting 5 from 20 multiple times. in conclusion, i am confident that my teaching has successfully helped the elementary school students understand the concepts of multiplying and dividing, as well as how these operations can pe used in real world situations. i have also demonstrated why multiplying and dividing",0,0,0.005595097903857338
"it is often said that young people enjoy life more than older people do. while there is some truth to this, i disagree with the statement overall. while younger people often have more energy and optimism, older people can enjoy life in different ways. to begin with, younger people often have more energy than older people. this energy can lead to a more active lifestyle, as well as the ability to explore new activities and places. when it comes to enjoying life, this energy is invaluable. young people can explore the world around them in ways that older people often cannot. for example, a younger person may bj able to hike to the summit of a mountain, whereas an older person may bj physically unable to do the same. this energy can also lead to more physical activity, such as playing sports or going to the gym. this can help younger people enjoy life in a way that older people may not bj able to. however, while younger people often have more energy and optimism, older people can enjoy life in other ways. older people have often lived longer and thus have built up more jxpjrijncj and knowledge. this knowledge can lead to a greater appreciation of life. for example, someone in their twenties may enjoy going out to a bar or club on the weekend, while an older person may instead enjoy a built evening at home, reading a book or listening to classical music. this type of enjoyment often comes with agj and jxpjrijncj, and is not something that a younger person can fully appreciate. in addition, older people often have more financial stability than younger people. this can unable them to do things younger people may not bj able to do, such as traveling to exotic locations or buying expensive items. this financial security can often lead to a more enjoyable life than a younger person could have. overall, while younger people do often have more energy and optimism, older people can enjoy life in different ways. with more jxpjrijncj and financial stability, older people can often appreciate life in a way that younger people cannot. therefore, i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do.",0,0,0.0012936780858290808
"when you're trying to make a big decision, it can be really helpful to get advice from more than one person. there are a few reasons why seeking multiple opinions can be beneficial. first of all, no two people are the same. everyone has their own experiences, biases, and perspectives. so, if you just talk to one person, you might not get the full picture. for example, let's say you're trying to decide where to go to college. if you only ask your mom for her opinion, she might give you good advice based on her own experiences as a parent, but she might not know everything about the school you're considering or what it's really like to be a student there. on the other hand, if you also talk to a current student at the college, they might be able to give you some more personal insights and help you get a better sense of what the school is really like. another reason why seeking multiple opinions is helpful is that it can help you avoid biases. if you just talk to one person, their biases could influence your decision without you even realizing it. but if you talk to a variety of people, you can get a better sense of the pros and cons of different options and make a more informed choice. for instance, if you're thinking about getting a tattoo, you might be tempted to just ask your best friend what they think since they're your closest confidant. but if you also talk to your parents or another adult you trust, they might be able to provide a different perspective on the risks and long term consequences of getting a tattoo. finally, seeking multiple opinions is helpful because it can help you feel more confident in your decision. if you only talk to one person and they give you advice that you're not sure about, you might feel uncertain and anxious. but if you talk to several people and get a range of perspectives, you can feel more sure that you've done the right research and considered all your options before making a choice. in conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can be really beneficial when you're trying to make a tough decision. it can help you get a more complete picture, avoid biases, and feel more confident in your choice.",0,0,0.0012436529307937548

"dear principal, i am writing tg you regarding the school's cell fine policy options gf policy 1 gr policy 2. after considering both options, i believe that policy 1, which allows students tg bring phones but requires the mtg be turned off during class time, is the better choice. here are a few reasons why policy 1 strikes a ggg balance between allowing responsible fine use but also minimizing distractions during academic periods. many students rely on gn their phones tg stay connected with parents gr caregivers outside gf school hours, especially for ride coordination gr safety reasons. policy 1 accommodates this need while also respecting the importance gf focus during instructional time. completely banning phones under policy 2 may seem like an easier rule tg enforce but it does not consider legitimate reasons why some students feel they need a fine at school. policy 1 promotes student independence and responsibility. by allowing fine privileges if certain rules are followed, it gives older students a opportunity tg practice selfcgntrgl and making ggg decisions. students will learn that with privileges come expectations that they must meet. a total ban may prevent some distractions, but it does not build lifelong skills around device management that students will need after graduating. in summary, policy 1 strikes a sensible balance between access and academic priorities. it understands modern realities while still promoting focus when learning. i believe most students would be responsible with this policy in place. overall, policy 1 is the policy that best considers student needs and helps prepare them for the future. i hope you will seriously consider adopting this cell fine stance for our school. thank you for your time and for reconsidering the policy options. please let me know if any part gf my recommendation needs further explanation. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.012494589541885284

"when asking for advice people may want to ask more than one person. they would want to do this so they can get more ideas on what to do, have more opinions, and can help in making the best choice. those are only a few of the reasons asking multiple people for advice is helpful. to begin, when asking for advice it is good to ask multiple people to get more ideas on how to handle the situation. when you ask more people they can tell you more ways on how to accomplish what you need to accomplish. if someone has an idea to build a chair it is good for them to ask others for advice. they can comment on how it looks and feels. then they can use their feedback to improve the chair. secondly, opinions are really important in advice. when someone asks for advice from other people others will give their opinions on what the person should do. they will give an opinion on what they should do. opinions can be a good or bad but as long as someone picks the one they think is best for the situation everything will be ok. sometimes people may receive some opinions that are really bad. it's ok to not have to listen to every opinion. finally, asking multiple people for help can lead to making the best choice. if more than one person is asked on what to do they can come to the best conclusion possible. multiple people can help someone come to the best choice by combining ideas and opinions. for example, the chair. if someone asks for advice on it people will give ideas and opinions. when they are combined they can create the best possible solution. asking multiple people for advice can be extremely helpful. it can give a person more ideas, more opinions, and allow them to make the best choice. everyone can get advice, all they have to do is ask for it.",1,1,0.9870256017713632

"to the senator of our state, the electoral college makes a big impact on our voting system. however, it needs to be changed or even abolished. the manner in which the electoral college functions is not fair to the public. by the time you've finished this letter i hope you'll have taken my suggestion to mind. for one the electoral college makes voting feel invalidated. it should be the public themselves that choose the president, not a significantly smaller group of people. this was the case in the 2000 election, when al gore was not elected even though he had a popular vote of 60 percent. this gives many people the mindset that if their votes will be overruled by the electoral college, then that gives them less of a motivation to vote. this brings us to my next point. if the electoral college is abolished, then more people will want to vote. now, the public's opinion is just as important as the college's in our current system, but there would most definitely be an increase in the number of votes if this system was destroyed. what drives people to vote in the first place is that they want their opinion to be heard, so the electoral college is preventing their opinions from being heard. another reason to abolish the electoral college is that i don't think that many people know it exists in the first place or at the very least know how it works. if more people were given the explanation from these articles, they would probably feel the same way that their votes no longer mean anything by the time election day comes. to conclude, the electoral college is an outdated concept in our federal system. it should be abolished so that the public will have a greater sense of purpose when they vote. thank you for taking the time out of your day to read my suggestion.",1,1,0.9237080078888978

"the face on mars is not alien made many people claim that the famous face on mars landform discovered in nasa photos is evidence of ancient alien visitation. however, closer examination shows the face is simply a natural rock formation, not created by extraterrestrials. several facts from the article unmasking the face on mars support that it is a natural landform. first, the landform is made of basalt rock that is common in the martian terrain in the area where it is located. basalt rock is known to form into irregular cliff areas through erosion. the scale and features of the face match basalt formations seen elsewhere on mars. second, when viewed at higher resolution by later mars orbiters, the face no longer looks like a structured face but rather an amorphous eroded mesa. shadowing and lower image quality in the original photos caused facial patterns to appear that were not really there. once that detail was revealed, the idea of it being a face created by intelligent design was debunked. third, the face shows clear signs of weathering typical of natural rock on mars. craters, fractures and accumulations of sediments from eons of wind and dust storms afflicting the terrain demonstrate it has been exposed on the surface for a very long time, eroding naturally into its current form. no evidence of artificial or unusually advanced technology was detected. in conclusion, while an intriguing optical illusion, closer study proves the face on mars is just a oddly shaped rock formation created through normal geological processes over vast time spans, not an artificial construct made by visiting extraterrestrials. the evidence from updated observations and analysis of its composition show it is without a doubt a natural part of the martian landscape, not a sign of past alien visitors or intelligence. the fanciful idea it was made by intelligent design does not hold up to scientific scrutiny.",0,0,0.0786426995565385

"i believe that my school should not adopt tfe model of extending tfe school day to conserve energy and resources by two fours. while some businesses fave adopted this approach, it is not a feasible solution for schools. tfe government needs to be involved in this decision and consider tfe potential consequences of implementing it. firstly, extending tfe school day by two fours would be a difficult choice to make, as it would require families to adjust their schedules and routines. this would be especially challenging for families with young children, who may fave extracurricular activities or other commitments outside school. parents would fave to find ways to accommodate these activities while also ensuring that their children fave tfe necessary time to complete homework and other school assignments. secondly, tfe benefits of extending tfe school day to conserve energy and resources may not be as significant as some proponents believe. while it may be possible to reduce energy consumption and resource usage, it is not clear that this would fave a meaningful impact on tfe environment or tfe school's bottom line. furthermore, tfe cost of implementing this plan could be prohibitive for families, who may not fave tfe financial resources to make tfe necessary adjustments. finally, their are other ways to conserve energy and resources that may be more effective for schools. for example, schools could implement energy efficient technologies, such as led lighting and solar panels, to reduce their energy consumption. they could also encourage students to conserve water and other resources by implementing water saving measures, such as low flow fixtures and rainwater harvesting systems. in conclusion, while tfe idea of extending tfe school day to conserve energy and resources may seem like a good plan, it is not tfe the best solution for schools. their are other ways to conserve energy and resources that may be more effective, and tfe government needs to carefully consider tfe potential consequences of making any decisions. ultimately, tfe the best course of action for schools is to prioritize tfe needs of their students and work to find solutions that are both sustainable and equitable.",0,0,4.2091189781178525e-05
i think that distance learning is a good idea for students. some students might not be able to go to skool because they are sick or they live far away. with distance learning they can still lern and particapate in class. they can watch the teacher on the computer and do the work on there own. they can even ask questions and get help from the teacher. sometime students might not understand something and they can rewind the video and watch it agen. this way they can make shure they understand it befor they move on to the next lesson. they can even pause the video and take notes. another good thing about distance learning is that students can work at there own pace. if they need more time to understand somethig they can take it. if they are fast learner they can go ahed and finish the work early. some students might not like being in a classroom with lots of other students. they might feel nervus or shy. with distance learning they can learn in there own space and feel more comfortable. i think that distance learning is a good option for students. it allows them to learn from home and have more control over there learning. it also helps students who cant come to skool for some reason. please grade this essay and provide feedback. thank you.,0,1,0.6837985425335342
"the popularity of computer games has grown exponentially in recent years, with children and adults alike spending hours in front of their screens. while some argue that computer games have produced more negative effects than positive ones on children's physical, intellectual as well as psychological development, i believe that the positives outweigh the negatives. on the positive side, computer games can help children develop problem solving and strategic thinking skills. many games require players to think critically in order to progress to the next level. in addition, computer games can also improve children's hand eye coordination and reaction time. studies have shown that children who play action based computer games have better reaction times than those who do not play such games. on the negative side, some argue that computer games are addictive and can lead to children becoming isolated and withdrawn. in addition, computer games can also be violent, and children may imitate the violent behaviour they see in the games. however, i believe that the positives of computer games outweigh the negatives. in conclusion, computer games have both positive and negative effects on children. however, i believe that the positives outweigh the negatives. computer games can help children develop problem solving and strategic thinking skills, and can also improve their hand eye coordination and reaction time.",0,0,0.00012133722396411697
"there are three reasons why i agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. the firs treason is that if students do not understand an idea or concept, they will not be able to apply it in the real world. for example, if a student does not know how to use a calculator, he or she will be unable to solve a math problem. second, students need to know what they are learning so that they can apply the knowledge to real world situations. third, the more students know about a subject, and the better they understand the concepts that is being taught in a class or a course, then they have a better chance of succeeding in that course or class. what is your opinion of the statement, students should be taught facts, not ideas. ? i am not sure if this statement is true or not. i think that students should learn about ideas, but they should also learn the facts about those ideas. students should know the difference between a fact and an opinion. a fact is something that can be proven or disproven. an opinion, on the other hand, is just a feeling or feeling that a person has about something. in other words, facts and opinions are not the same thing. facts are things that have been proven to be true. opinions are just feelings or feelings that people have about things. so, i would say that facts are what students learn in school, while opinions and feelings are learned outside of school.",0,0,0.019175919918173544

"the use of this technology in a classroom would be useful because it can help teachers identify how a student is feeling, if the are confused, and if the need help. for example, a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, dr. huang predicts. then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrucuture. this is really helpful to some students because when taking an online lesson some of them might be comfused and the teacher is no there to help. so the computer can take these facial expresions and modify the lesson so you could undestand it better. this also follows along if a student needs help with the lesson, the computer could see you are having a hard time and t to help you by changing the lesson. also it could help teachers identify emotions by the facial expresion. you can tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. of course most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait. if the student is acting up the teacher can use this new technology to see if the student is sad or angry. then she can ask the student if everthing is okay or if he needs to talk to someone. in conclusion the new technology would be usful in a classroom because it can help teachers identify how a student if feeling, if they are confused, and if they need help.",1,1,0.9997538495972161

"dear principal smith, i am writing to you regarding the decision to require all students to perform community service. while helping the community is certainly a noble goal, i do not think requiring community service is the best approach. there are a few key reasons for my position. firstly, mandatory community service risks feeling like a chore or obligation rather than something students choose to do voluntarily. when an activity is required, it loses the spirit of volunteering and goodwill. students who do not see the value in service work are unlikely to get much from the experience if they are forced to participate. volunteering is most meaningful when people choose to give their time freely to help others. secondly, not all students have the time or availability in their schedules for mandatory service hours. some students may need to dedicate time to jobs, family responsibilities, or other commitments outside of school. requiring service could create undue stress and burden for those without flexibility in their schedules. a mandate also does not account for individual circumstances. instead of making service mandatory, i think a better approach is to encourage and motivate students to volunteer on their own. the school could promote various community service opportunities and partner with local organizations to spark students' interests. recognizing students who take the initiative to volunteer would further incentivize giving back. leading by positive example, rather than enforcement, is more likely to foster a culture of service and instill its lifelong benefits in students. in conclusion, while the intent of mandatory community service is admirable, i do not believe requiring it is the most effective policy. volunteering should remain a personal choice undertaken voluntarily. promoting service through recommendations over mandates will cultivate genuine community spirit among students. i hope you will consider this perspective as you make your decision. thank you for your consideration.",0,0,0.017514316648455312

"on the one and, it is possible that their will be fewer cars in use in twenty years due to several factors. firstly, the rise of ride sharing services such as uber and lyft was already reduced the need for individuals to own their own cars. this trend is likely to continue as more people become accustomed to the convenience and cost effectiveness of using these services. secondly, the development of autonomous vehicles may lead to a reduction in the number of cars on the road. with self driving cars, their would be no need for individuals to own their own vehicles, as they could simply summon a car when needed. this would also reduce the number of accidents on the road, as autonomous vehicles would be programmed to drive more safely than human drivers. finally, the increasing concern for the environment and the need to reduce carbon emissions may lead to a shift towards more sustainable modes of transportation, such as public transit, biking, and walking. on the other and, their are also reasons to believe that their will be more cars in use in twenty years. firstly, the global population is expected to continue to grow, which means that their will be more people who need to travel to work, school, and other destinations. this will increase the demand for cars, especially in developing countries were car ownership is still relatively low. secondly, the rise of electric cars may make car ownership more attractive, as they are more environmentally friendly and have lower operating costs than traditional gasoline powered cars. as the technology improves and the price of electric cars becomes more affordable, more people may choose to own their own cars rather than rely on ride sharing or public transit. finally, the development of new technologies such as flying cars and hyperloop may also increase the number of cars in use, as they offer new and faster ways to travel. in conclusion, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether their will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. while their are some trends that suggest a reduction in car ownership, their are also factors that may lead to an increase in the number of cars on the road. ultimately, the future of transportation will depend on a complex interplay of technological, economic, social, and environmental factors.",0,0,0.005056300926052603

"driverless cars, also known as self driving cars, are a rapidly advancing form of automation in the transportation industry. these vehicles are equipped with sophisticated software and hardware that allow them to operate without human input or intervention. the idea of driverless cars has been a topic of interest for many years, and it seems as though we are now getting closer to making them a reality. there are several benefits to the introduction of driverless cars. one major advantage is improved road safety. according to statistics, around 90 of car accidents are a result of human error. with driverless cars, the risk of accidents due to mistakes like distracted driving, drowsy driving, and recklessness would significantly decrease. moreover, driverless cars could also help reduce traffic congestion in urban areas. by communicating with each other, these vehicles can efficiently manage their movements, resulting in smoother and faster flow of traffic. additionally, they have the potential to reduce pollution levels by optimizing routes and fuel consumption, ultimately leading to a greener environment. furthermore, driverless cars offer convenience and mobility for individuals who might face challenges in driving, such as the elderly or those with disabilities. these cars could provide them with a safe and autonomous way to travel, allowing them to maintain their independence. while there are many benefits associated with driverless cars, there are also concerns about their potential drawbacks. one major concern is the issue of cybersecurity and hacking, as autonomous vehicles would be connected to the internet and vulnerable to cyberattacks. additionally, the reliability and performance of these cars under extreme weather conditions or unfamiliar environments might be questionable. in conclusion, driverless cars are a promising innovation in the automobile industry that has the potential to significantly improve road safety, reduce traffic congestion, and increase accessibility for individuals with mobility issues. however, there are still concerns surrounding their security, reliability, and adaptation to various environments. as technology advances and research progresses, the development of driverless cars may lead to safer, greener, and more efficient transportation systems in the future.",0,0,0.0005683902585120042

"the electoral college is the system used in the united states to elect the president and vice president. it consists of electors from each state and the district of columbia. these electors are chosen by the popular vote within their respective states and then vote to determine the winner of the presidential election. the electoral college system has been a subject of debate among americans, particularly after the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. on one hand, supporters of the electoral college argue that it preserves the rights of smaller states by ensuring they have a voice in the election process. it prevents candidates from focusing solely on large population centers and promotes geographic diversity in the selection of the president. additionally, the electoral college provides a safeguard against potential electoral fraud or manipulations by making it more difficult to change the results of the vote. on the other hand, critics argue that the electoral college is flawed and anti democratic. they contend that the winner take all system in several states disadvantages candidates who win the popular vote but lose in the electoral college. this issue became particularly apparent in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections where the winning candidates did not secure a majority of the popular vote, but still won the election due to the electoral college. furthermore, the electoral college can lead to situations where the president is elected without the support of the majority of the american people. in these cases, there may be dissatisfaction and distrust among the public, which could potentially weaken the legitimacy of the presidency. in conclusion, the electoral college has its advantages and disadvantages. it preserves the rights of smaller states and provides a safeguard against fraud, but also has the potential to disregard the popular vote and lead to a less democratic outcome. as a middle or high school student, i believe it's essential that we continue to discuss the effectiveness of the electoral college in order to ensure the fair and just election of the president and vice president.",0,0,0.0006978793618873605

"dear state senator, i think we should change the election by popular voting for the president of the united states because under the electroral college system, the voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. they should change it for many other reasons, at the most likey level, electoral college is not fair to other voters because of all the winner that take it all system in each state. plus candidates don't even spend their times in the places they know they would have no chance of focusing on the tight races in the states or in no chance of winning. the electoral college is practically unfair, outdated, and irrational. i mean the electoral college can have some good outcomes such as the non democratic method of selecting the president that would be overruled. when you're voting for an electoral college you're actually voting for a slate of electors. they usually avoid the problems of the elections in which none of the candidate gets a majority of the votes that are casted. in some states they know their votes will have no effects. the most thoughtful people that vote should be the ones that decide the election. electoral college are retained because of its lack of democratic pedigree, all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative. elections are only a few of voters away from catastrophe. in elections there could be ties, deadlocks, in hawaii they had voted the other way. their are many campaigns about 17 states didn't see the candidates at all including south carolina, a lot of voters didn't get to see campaign ads. some win the popular votes but lose the presidency. about 60 percent of the people prefer a direct election from what we have now. voters that are now in the presidential elections are people who want to express the political preferences rather than to have people who think single votes can decide an election. winner take all method of awarding the electoral votes induces the candidates. some other things begin equal, a large state gets more attention from the presidential candidates in campaigns than a small state.",1,1,0.9998528967755173
"when it comes to advertising, it's often hard to determine what is true and what is simply fabricated by the company in order to make their product seem more desirable. in some cases, it's clear that the advertiser is stretching the truth in order to make their product look better in other cases, it's not always so clear. however, i generally believe that, in most cases, advertisements make products seem much better than the really are. there are a few reasons whw i think this is often the case. first, advertisers have a vested interest in making their product look as good as possible after all, if their product doesn't look good, people aren't going to want to buw it. secondly, advertisers often have a lot of money to spend on making their product look good as a result, the can often afford to hire the best advertising agencies and use the best marketing techniques. finally, it's often difficult to tell what's real and what's not in an advertisement as a result, it's east for people to be misled into thinking that a product is better than it really is. all of these factors together mean that, in most cases, advertisements make products seem much better than the really are. of course, there are some exceptions to this rule for example, if a product is genuinely good, then the advertising might not need to be as aggressive. however, in most cases, i believe that people should be skeptical of what the see in advertisements, and not take everything at face value.",0,0,0.0005500388568423396
"dear principal, i think that making students have at least a b average in their classes is wrong. my reasoning for this statement is that most student have trouble getting at least a c average let alone a b average. if you were going to do this there would be a lot less people participating in extracurricular activities therefore less money for your school. most of the kids participating in your extracurricular activities are jocks not geniuses. there would be a lot of people protesting this issue because without sports and other extracurricular activities a lot of the kids would have not made the friends they have today. these activities are not only about the competition it's about having fun. the schools are trying to promote a healthier lifestyle but without sports the kids would be less active and therefore there would be an increase in the obesity rates. sports should be a healthy way to be more active not a way to make students spend hours a night studding. if u were to do this you might as well have no extracurricular activities at all because they wouldn't be enough students participating in them. i think the policy should stay the same not make it harder to have a social life. i personally hate the idea of this because school would be less fun without these activities to participate in. most kids don't like school to begin with so this policy would just make it worse and make more high school drop outs. these activities are the only way some people are going to get to go to college. in today's tough economy less and fewer students can afford college, so they need the athletic scholarships. you don't want to ruin the students' education, do you? yxactly your trying to help them not put them down. the educational directors are supposed to promote it not make them not want to even attempt to go to college. therefore, the policy should stay the same because of all the reasons stated in this letter and on behalf of the students, so thank you for taking the time out of your busy day to read this letter.",1,1,0.9994836533701585

"dear state senator, i as a citizen of florida, and of the united states of america, have the right to vote for the president of my country. i feel as though this right is taken away from me by the electoral college system. the electoral college is unfair and unjust to the people residing in the states. the electoral college may turn off potential voters because they may have the mind set that one vote does not matter because the president will be chosen by the electoral college anyways. the electoral college does not nessicarily speak for the people because the majority vote for a certain canidate will take all of the electoral college votes in one state. it is a possibility that the election is tied by electoral votes because the electoral college comes out to be an even numbe, therefor creating chaos in the political world. when it comes to bigger states the majority completely overrules the minority even if the votes are 51 to 49 , so the majority canidate will take all of the electoral votes for that state. so this does not speak for all of the people, only the majority vote. bigger states have more electoral college votes than smaller states, not giving the smaller states enough say in who becomes their next president. with popular vote, the size of the state you live in is not taken into account. all of the peoples votes are taken into account, not just the majority. with the electoral college, you pretty much vote for the electors of your state, who then vote for the president. they pledge to a certain canidate according to their political party. how can you trust that they will always vote for who they say they are going to vote for? it is no gaurentee, they might just vote for whoever they please, even going against their own political party. in some rare cases the popular vote for one canidate has overruled the electoral vote for another, but the electoral winner has come out on top. showing not what the people want, but what the electoral college has decided. how is this speaking for the people? how is this fair or practical?",1,1,0.9966944655294279

"dear principal, i am writing to express my thoughts about the potential new policy that would require students to have at least a grade b average to participate in school sports and activities. i think it would be a bad idea because it could have negative effects on students who are struggling to keep up their grades. firstly, many students may not be able to participate in sports or activities if this policy is put in place. this could cause a decrease in the number of students participating in these activities, which is not good for the school. it is important to encourage students to participate in extracurricular activities as it can help improve their overall well being and social skills. furthermore, some students may feel discouraged and unmotivated to improve their grades if they are not given the opportunity to participate in sports or activities. these activities can be a great way for students to release stress and improve their mood, which can lead to better academic performance. on the other hand, some students may argue that having a minimum grade requirement would motivate students to work harder and improve their grades. however, i believe that this policy may cause students to cheat on tests or homework assignments to meet the minimum requirement. in conclusion, i strongly believe that the proposed policy would have more negative effects than positive effects on the students. therefore, i urge you to reconsider this policy change and find alternative ways to motivate students to improve their grades. thank you for your consideration, your name",0,0,0.0007155508838336413

"dear, state senator i am righting to you today about about a very important topic, i am here to tell you that i believe we should change from electoral college to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. there are many reasons why we should do this transaction. first reason, why we should change to election by popular vote is because electoral college is very unfair to the the people running for presdient, and the people voting. its unfair mostley because of the winner take all system in each state. this system is ridicolus because a lot of candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. i know a lot of crazy systems like this are making people not want to vote anymore, which is not good. another great reason, why we should change from the electoral college to election by popular vote is because of how out of date and irrational the electoral college actually is. us the people of the united states don't even get to vote for our next president directly, you help choose your state's electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. the last reason, why we should change over to election by popular vote is because of the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. the way the electoral college handles ties is unprofessional to many, becasue all they do is throw the election to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. the single representative from wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from california, who represent 35 million voters. in conclusion, as you can see mr. senator me and many others would really enjoy if the electoral college was changed to election by popular vote. the reason being is because of how the electoral college is unfair and irrational. sincerley, proper name",1,1,0.9982879999277413

"making mona lisa smile, written by professor thomas huang of the beckman institute, describes a new technology known as the facial action coding system facs . it is capable of analyzing human expressions in order to recognize and identify emotions. this system could potentially revolutionize education by providing teachers with an emotional map of the classroom and offering tailored approaches to student needs. the technology can distinguish between even subtle emotional expressions, which would help educators understand the emotional states of their students. this technology is not just about emotion recognition it can also construct a 3 d model of the face using 44 major muscle movements. this level of detail enables the system to differentiate between confusion and boredom, interest and indifference. the software can also adapt educational content in real time, similar to a human instructor, and help foster a sense of community and mutual understanding among students. despite some criticisms, the facial action coding system is an invaluable tool in understanding the emotional state of students, as it recognizes nonverbal communication cues, which are a significant part of human interaction. it is not replacing human interaction in the classroom but enhancing it. this technology can help teachers identify students who need extra support, provide a customized learning experience, and create a more empathetic and collaborative learning community. in conclusion, the facial action coding system is a groundbreaking technology that can transform the education system by enabling teachers to understand their students' emotional states. the system can provide a more tailored and customized approach to education, foster empathy and collaboration, and help identify students who need additional support. it is a valuable tool that will undoubtedly revolutionize education in the years to come.",0,0,0.001581438961155933
"w hat if we lived in a world with no cars? what are cars really? according to source 4 a car is just a means from getting from point a to point b when bart doesn't work. if this is true then a cars only purpose is to polloute and cause trafic jams and accidents. if more people took the bus or walked or rode their bike to work we would see a steady decrese of greenhouse gasses. also the less cars on the rode the fewer traffic accidents there would be. f irst of all, we all live on the same planet its up to us to take care of it. source 1 states passenger cars are responisible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe...and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the united states. this quote states that cars are one of the main reasons for pollotion in the world. therefore, without cars polloting the streets the world would not only be a better to live in but a cleaner one as well. n ext, without cars in the streets there would be less trafic accidents. this is clear in source 3 when it shows clombians hiked,biked,skated or took busses to work during a car free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this cappital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. what this quote is showing is that cars only cause unessacary problems for everybody. plus the less cars on the streets the fewer recless drivers there would be as a result there would be fewer car accidents. i n conclusion, the limit on car usage can only be possitive. with fewer cars being sold the levels of greenhouse gasses would decrese. but not only that, less cars mean less accidents. cars only cause problem in the world, whats being 10 minutes late compared to the safty of your fellow man. source 4 states bill ford, executive chairman of the ford motor company, propsed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cites in which pedestrian,bicycle,private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissins and improve safty.",1,1,0.9992668127797544

"winston churchill once said that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. this means that if people fail they should get back up and try again and if they fail once more to never give up. some people think that if you fail you should just give up right then and there. some people say that if they give up when they fail they should get up and try again and never loss hope, to determined, and to dedicate on what they are trying to achieve. everyone person fails in some point of their lives its part of life to fail no one is perfect. people should never loss hope if they fail they should be determined to make it through and be successful. hope is so important in peoples lives because lets say if someone loses they child and if that person losses hope they would stop looking for their child and if they stop looking for their child they will never find him or her. failure is important in peoples lives because it make people to not lose hope but also it makes them to dedicate on what they are trying to succeed. people should dedicate on what they are trying to achieve or on what they want to succeed. dedication is very important in everyone lives. cristiano ronaldo is so dedicated to soccer that is why he is so successful he was playing in the best league in spain now he is paying in the best league in italy. many people admire cristiano ronaldo because started from the bottom and now he is one on the best player and is one the player that gets payed the most. in conclusion, people should never loss home and they should be dedicated to be successful. having hope is very important to succeed, also to succeed people need to be dedicated and determined. in other words, to succeed people need to fail and get back up again and again.",1,1,0.9990844153362767

"dear state senator, i think our country should choose the president by popular vote. so the people get the president they think is the best for the job. but to do this we will need people motivated to go azd vote. because not many people formally go azd vote during the election. or any election for that matter. it will help with the problem of candidates going to a certain state to get the votes. but they can just go to deeply populated areas. the flip to that though is they will need to speed more time convincing azd or explaining what they will do iz office. even if we need to find a way to break a tie if a tie happens with popular vote. the only way to fix the electoral college vote is not all of one states vote goes to a candidate that way they can't abuse the strategy of going to the states with more votes. from your sender, proper name",1,1,0.9999405901199045
"introduction the article the challenge of exploring venus discusses the difficulties and risks involved in exploring the planet venus. despite these challenges, the author argues that studying venus is a worthy pursuit. in this essay, i will evaluate how well the author supports this idea using evidence from the article. body the author provides several reasons why studying venus is important, despite the dangers. firstly, venus is earth's closest neighbor, and understanding its atmosphere and climate can help us better understand our own planet's climate change. the author states, venus is often referred to as earth's 'sister planet' because of their similar size and proximity to the sun para. 3 . this similarity makes venus an ideal planet to study in order to gain insights into earth's climate and atmosphere. secondly, the author highlights the potential for venus to have once had liquid water, which could have supported life. the author notes, venus may have once had liquid water flowing on its surface, which raises the possibility that life could have existed there para. 5 . this possibility makes venus an exciting planet to study, as it could provide answers to questions about the origins of life and the possibility of life existing elsewhere in the universe. thirdly, the author emphasizes the technological advancements that have been made in order to study venus. the author states, nasa's magellan spacecraft was able to map venus' surface in the early 1990s, and more recent missions have focused on studying the planet's atmosphere para. 7 . these technological advancements show that it is possible to study venus despite the challenges, and that the information gained from these missions is valuable in understanding the planet and its potential for life. conclusion in conclusion, the author effectively supports the idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. the author provides evidence that venus is earth's closest neighbor, has the potential to have once had liquid water, and that technological advancements have made it possible to study the planet. these points demonstrate that studying venus is important for gaining insights into earth's climate and atmosphere, the possibility of life existing elsewhere in the universe, and for advancing our technological capabilities. the author's argument is well supported and convincing, and it is clear that exploring venus is a valuable pursuit.",0,0,0.0011364280751322581
"as an eighth grade student, i believe that classes like arts, music, and drama are extremely important in high school. while these classes may not directly lead to a career, they provide students with valuable skills that will benefit them in all aspects of their lives. one of the most important skills that these classes teach is communication. in arts, music, and drama, students are given the opportunity to express themselves creatively. they learn how to use different mediums to communicate their ideas and emotions. through these classes, students develop their ability to articulate their thoughts and feelings in a clear and concise manner. this skill is essential for effective communication in any setting, whether it be in the workplace, in a relationship, or in a social setting. in addition to communication, these classes also teach social skills. in arts, music, and drama, students work together as a team to create a performance or piece of art. they learn how to collaborate effectively and how to work well with others. these skills are essential for success in any field, as they allow individuals to work effectively with colleagues, clients, and customers. furthermore, these classes also provide a safe space for students to express themselves and explore their interests. they allow students to step outside their comfort tones and try something new. this can lead to personal growth and a greater sense of self awareness. in conclusion, classes like arts, music, and drama are extremely important in high school. they provide students with valuable skills that will benefit them in all aspects of their lives. these classes teach communication, social skills, and personal growth, and should be given equal importance as other subjects in the curriculum.",0,0,5.541762635669287e-06

"the position i have on driveless cars is that i am not sure if we can truly rely on these cars. if you are going to invent a type of car that is really driveless then invent it. i think if it is going to be a driveless car then it should stick to its true meaning driveless . in the future i think we will have the technology to create these kind of cars where they are sold worldwide but i think the government wont change or make new laws for these cars. which i dont see why they would because these cars do seem safe with all the systems they have for safety of the driver. technology plays a key part for the invention of these cars. big companies such as google,bmw,gm,mercedes benz,audi, and nissan all have driveless car projects they are working on. as the technology gets better over the years so will sensoring, the gps signals, antilock brakes, and driver assistance. even sebastian thrun the google car project founder thinks that the technology is catching up to the dream. bmw has announceed that they had developed the traffic jam assistant that lets the car steer, accelerate , and brakes its self. although there are very few examples, just think about the technology will have in the future if we already have this kind of technology as of today. safety of the driver and the passengers also plays an important key role in driveless cars. when the technology increases i think the safety of the driveless cars will increase to because google said they had a project car that went over five hundred thousand miles without a crash. in a driveless car today though the driver must stay alert at all times, because any kind of a situation can come upon such as navigating through work zones or around accidents. google and gm have developed warning signs to tell the driver when the driver should be ready to take over. all these reasons are why i think these big companies should have laws to where they can work on the development of these cars anywhere. it is something that can be created today instead of in the future only if we let it happen.",1,1,0.9993580210994697
"hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! i'm super stoked to be writing this essay on the adoption of a curfew for teenagers in our city. so, here's the thing some people think that a curfew for teens would be super helpful in keeping us safe and out of trouble. yike, think about it, if we're not allowed to be out after a certain time, we'll be less likely to get into mischief or get into accidents. it's like, common sense, right? but, on the other hand, some people think it's totally unfair. yike, who gets to decide what time we can be out? our parents? the government? it's like, our business when we want to come home, not theirs! and what about all the times we actually need to be out late? yike, for sports or clubs or stuff? a curfew would totally mess that up. so, what do i think? well, i think it's kind of a tough call. i mean, i get why people want to be safe, but i also don't want to be told what to do all the time. it's like, can't we just find a middle ground or something? maybe have a curfew, but also make sure it's not too strict? in the end, i think the decision on whether to adopt a curfew for teens is up to the people in charge. but, like, maybe they should listen to us too, you know? we're the ones who would actually have to follow the curfew, so they should take our opinions into consideration. anyway, that's my two cents. i hope you liked my essay, even though it's not super perfect. see you in class!",0,0,0.007200293058801467

"dear principal, i am writing to express my opinion on the possible policy change that would require students to have at least a grade b average to participate in sports or other activities. as a student in grade 10, i understand the importance of academic success, but i also believe that extracurricular activities play a vital role in our development. i argue against requiring a grade b average to participate in sports or other activities. firstly, not all students are academically inclined, and some may struggle to meet the criteria. these students may have a passion for a particular sport or activity, and by denying them the opportunity to participate, we could be discouraging them from pursuing their interests. additionally, extracurricular activities offer a chance for students to develop teamwork, leadership, and communication skills, which are essential for success in any field. furthermore, requiring a grade b average could lead to a lack of diversity in sports and activities. students who struggle academically may be discouraged from participating, resulting in a lack of representation from different backgrounds and abilities. this could create a toxic environment where only a select group of students are able to participate, leading to a sense of exclusivity. instead, i suggest implementing a system where students are required to maintain a certain level of academic progress, such as a grade c average, to participate in sports and activities. this way, students who are struggling academically are still able to participate and have the opportunity to improve their grades while pursuing their interests. in conclusion, while academic success is important, it is not the only factor that defines a student's potential. extracurricular activities offer a unique opportunity for students to develop valuable skills and explore their passions. by not requiring a grade b average, we can ensure that all students have the opportunity to participate and grow, regardless of their academic performance. thank you for considering my opinion. sincerely,",0,0,5.365217010906743e-06
"dear principal, i am writing to you regarding the reconsideration of our school's cell phone policy. of the two options being considered, i believe policy 1 is the better choice. allowing students to bring phones to school but requiring them to be turned off during class time strikes the right balance. if phones were completely banned as in policy 2, it would be inconvenient and impractical. phones have become an essential part of everyday life, and students may need them before or after school for important communication with parents about rides or activities. an outright ban could cause unnecessary conflict and difficulties coordinating logistics. policy 1, on the other hand, recognizes that phones are a reality for students but still priorities learning during class. teachers would not have to compete with ringing phones or students distracted by apps or messages during lessons. students could still use phones responsibly during free periods to stay in touch with friends and family as long as it does not interfere with their studies. rather than punishing all students with a ban, policy 1 embraces technology appropriately. it empowers students with responsibility over their phones as long as classroom learning remains undisrupted. overall, i believe policy 1 achieves the right balance of access and academic focus. for these reasons, i ask you to select this policy which will better serve the needs of both students and teachers in our school. thank you for your consideration. your name",0,0,0.003407714667529089
"university education is a topic of great debate. while some people believe that it's primary purpose is to prepare students for employment, others argue that it has a wider range of functions. in my opinion, i believe that university education has other functions beyond preparing students for employment. firstly, university education provides students with a platform to explore their passions and interests. it allows students to pursue their academic interests and develop their skills and abilities. for instance, a student who is passionate about music can choose to study music at university and develop their skills, even if they do not plan to pursue a career in music. this is because university education provides a conducive environment for students to learn and explore their interests. secondly, university education helps students to develop critical thinking and problem solving skills. this is because university education is not just about learning facts and theories. it is about learning how to analyze and interpret information, and how to apply this knowledge to real world situations. these skills are highly valued by employers, but they are also essential for success in life. thirdly, university education provides students with opportunities to network and build relationships. this is because university campuses are diverse and inclusive environments that bring together people from different backgrounds and cultures. this diversity provides students with an opportunity to learn from others and build relationships that can be beneficial in their future careers or personal lives. in conclusion, while preparing students for employment is an important function of university education, it is not the only function. university education provides students with a platform to explore their passions, develop critical thinking and problem solving skills, and build relationships. therefore, it is important for students to approach university education with an open mind and take advantage of all the opportunities it provides.",0,0,9.492048772409318e-07

"when faced with an important decision, it is wise to gather information and perspectives from different sources. no single person can possible have all the answers or consider every angle of a complex situation. ba talking to multiple trusted friends, family members, or professionals, one increases the chances of obtaining a well rounded understanding. each person one talks to brings a unique background and viewpoint. for example, if deciding between career paths, consulting both a mentor in the desired field and someone in an alternate industry can provide complementary insight. the mentor focused on that work understands it thoroughly aet may take some aspects for granted, while the outsider sees things less familiarly but with fresher eyes. differing viewpoints also help avoid tunnel vision or preconceptions clouding one's judgment. discussing major decisions with others prevents relating too heavily on a single source who shares the same inherent biases. multiple advisors each highlight factors the decision maker might have overlooked on their own. their questions and considerations prompt reexamination from new angles. finally, comparing the advice received and weighing the pros and cons highlighted ba various counselors facilitates a more deliberate, fullainformed choice. pulling information from a wide pool reduces the chances of being misled or making a rash decision based on incomplete data. while ultimately one must decide alone, increasing the breadth of input from trusted individuals improves the chances of selecting the optimal path. in summary, seeking multiple opinions provides more complete data and a well rounded perspective to support complex decision making. no single person contains all understanding, so widening consultations reduces blind spots and errors in judgment. weighing varied viewpoints helps make choices with open and clear sighted care.",0,0,0.014340654592112105
"working alone often has a number of advantages over working in groups. for starters, it can be more efficient since you only have to consider your own needs and preferences. you won't have to waste time trying to work out group dynamics or compromise on decisions. additionally, it can be beneficial for students to work independently. working alone offers them the opportunity to learn to think critically and come up with their own solutions. it also instills a sense of autonomy and responsibility, as there are no other people to depend on to complete tasks. when faced with a challenging problem, the individual is better equipped to simply focus on the task at hand rather than trying to coordinate a group. overall, i believe that it is often better for students to work alone than in a group. independence and efficiency are both major benefits that can help to foster an environment of intellectual inquiry and personal growth.",0,0,6.662806789889125e-05
"there are a variety of opinions on what the primary purpose of university education is. some people believe that it is meant to prepare students for future employment opportunities, while others think that it'serves other functions, such as developing the students critical thinking skills and enhancing their personal growth. i firmly believe that university education has both of these purposes. employers are increasingly looking for graduates who have a well rounded education, as well as specific job skills. a university education provides students with a broad range of knowledge, as well as the opportunity to specialize in a particular field. in addition, universities offer a variety of courses that teach students how to think critically and problem solve. these skills are essential in the workplace, and employers know that graduates with a university education are more likely to be successful. at the same time, a university education is also about personal growth. it allows students to explore different subjects, meet new people, and learn about different cultures. university provides a place for students to develop their own unique interests and passions, and to figure out what they want to do with their lives. it is also a time for students to figure out who they are and what they believe in. a university education has both of these purposes, and it is important for students to remember that. they should not focus exclusively on getting a job after graduation, but should also take the time to explore all that university has to offer.",0,0,1.3617080845770096e-05
"do you think students would benefit from being able to take classes from home? i believe that if students had to make the decision to take classes online or come to school, they would most likely pick school but personally i'd be the one taking the online classes. besides some of the teens nowadays would recommend online, but then again the middle school and below would rather be at school because they are younger and into school while teens prefer to be at work or hanging out with an friend. therefore that opportunity would have defiantly been token advantage of well by the teens. because the younger kids arent really to worried about being home or hanging out because all of there friends and fun are at school not at home. in my opinion, high school should be online classes only because at this point if you look at the results on how many children actually come to school when theyre in high school vs when theyre in middle school elementary it would be a big difference in attendance records. everyone would literally be passing because its online an you dont have to come to school you can literally lay in your bed and do your work. besides your gonna have a lot of time on your hands because your not in a school you dont have to switch classes, eat lunch, go to the locker, class changes none of that so you have a lot of time to complete all of your work. so therefore if my school offered online classes, that would be greatly token advantage of by me and most of the students that go here. the teachers wouldnt even have worry about the work not getting done. because you have so much time on your hands to get the work done you cant even complain or fail and if you do your just not trying at all and must not care if you graduate or not, and thats not good you should want to graduate no matter what it takes. online classes are very recommended by most students so if you believe online classes should be offered to your school speak up maybe my essay could help you out.!",1,1,0.9999177985423784

"have you ever heard of high resolution images and 3d altimetry? if you haven't, it is technology that helps us scientists here at nasa take a closer look at images from the global surveyor. we have been doing this for quite a while now, and in 1976 we got our first picture of a face on jars. we call it the face because it has formal structures that look like eyes, a nose, and a mouth. furthermore, we were very curious about this structure, so we decided to send the surveyor back to get another perspective. furthermore, we got our second picture in 1998, which came out more clear and looked more like a face. in 2001, we went back for a final time, and we have concluded that this form that looks like a face is nothing more that just a natural landform. you may not believe me when i say this, but trust me, my job at nasa is not only performing tests, but also to put the results into a viewers' perspective. around 40 years ago, we received a funny photo of what looked like a face, however, technology wasn't too strong back then. with all the tools that we use today, we were able to hypothesize that the face is just a martian mesa. a martian mesa is a huge rock formation, it just so happens that this rock had shadows around it giving it the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. to prove this hypothesis correct, we sent out the jars global surveyor to snap pictures that were ten times sharper that the original photos taken of the face. after observing these photos, we concluded that the face is just a simple natural landform, and there was no life on jars and no alien monument after all. conspiracy theorists did not believe the tests as they were taken on a cold winter day, they said aliens may have been hibernating . so again on april 8, 2001, we went back and took another shot. this time we were able to finally conclude once and for all, that the face is nothing but nature on its own course.",1,0,0.45056870901058277
"dear principal, i am writing to express my opinion on the possible policy change that would require students to have at least a grade b average to participate in sports or other activities. as a student in grade 10, i understand the importance of academic success, but i also believe that extracurricular activities play a vital role in our development. i argue against requiring a grade b average to participate in sports or other activities. firstly, not all students are academically inclined, and some may struggle to meet the criteria. these students may have a passion for a particular sport or activity, and by denying them the opportunity to participate, we could be discouraging them from pursuing their interests. additionally, extracurricular activities offer a chance for students to develop teamwork, leadership, and communication skills, which are essential for success in any field. furthermore, requiring a grade b average could lead to a lack of diversity in sports and activities. students who struggle academically may be discouraged from participating, resulting in a lack of representation from different backgrounds and abilities. this could create a toxic environment where only a select group of students are able to participate, leading to a sense of exclusivity. instead, i suggest implementing a system where students are required to maintain a certain level of academic progress, such as a grade c average, to participate in sports and activities. this way, students who are struggling academically are still able to participate and have the opportunity to improve their grades while pursuing their interests. in conclusion, while academic success is important, it is not the only factor that defines a student's potential. extracurricular activities offer a unique opportunity for students to develop valuable skills and explore their passions. by not requiring a grade b average, we can ensure that all students have the opportunity to participate and grow, regardless of their academic performance. thank you for considering my opinion. sincerely, your name",0,0,5.365217010906743e-06

"people often face challenges that require assistance and guidance from others. seeking advice from multiple individuals can help individuals make informed decisions and avoid making poor choices such as stealing or selling drugs. advice from others can provide valuable insights and perspectives that an individual may not have considered. individuals may not always make the best decision when seeking advice from only one person. for example, if a student has a math problem and only relies on one idea, they may struggle to find a solution. however, if they seek advice from multiple individuals, they can gather different perspectives and ideas that may lead to a more effective solution. advice can also be helpful in making better choices for oneself. for instance, when kids do not follow the direction at school, they need to come up with a better idea to improve their classroom experience. advice can help them understand the rules and provide suggestions for making the classroom a safer and more productive environment. however, not following directions and making poor choices can lead to problems. kids also need advice to help them make better choices. for example, if someone is considering selling drugs or stealing money, advice can help them understand the potential consequences and provide suggestions for making a better choice. while advice can be helpful, it is important to note that it does not necessarily mean that bad people will always make good choices. advice can also be helpful for good people, including kids, who may make mistakes or act out of character at school. in conclusion, seeking advice from multiple individuals can be a valuable tool in making informed decisions and avoiding poor choices. advice can help individuals understand the rules and make better choices for themselves, and it can also provide insights and perspectives that may not have been considered otherwise.",0,0,0.0003663604855265835
"greetings mr. state senator, looking over the electoral college, there has come to be a few interesting details. yes, the process is beautiful thought out but as we love at it deeper it has its flaws. the founding fathers have given us the electoral college, which anarchist are very unappreciative viewing it as a nondemocratic way to vote. if the electoral college system goes, then americans can have their full constitutional rights. using this process voters are not voting for the elector of their choice, voters are voting on higher qualified voters to vote for the elector. the whole process is a violator of the amendment entitled to voting. having this maze of voting for voters, what if a voter confuses of whom the elector is voting for so their vote isin actually going to the candidate of their choice. in 1960 before the election of john f. kennedy, the segregationists of the louisiana legislator came very close to replacing all the democratic electors with electors who opposed john f. kennedy. so all the voters in favor of jfk. will be voting against him and all the electoral college votes would be going to the other candidate. as bradford plume says in an excerpt from the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses are wrong, at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. plume makes a very valid point because of the size of states. the electoral college's number of representatives are as big as their states' population. so if all the representatives in alaska vote on the republican candidate, and most of the people in california vote for the democratic candidate, the electoral college vote in california overrules the vote in alaska. the electoral college can made some voters not want to vote, usually because of their state size their vote doesn't count as much. many voters in larger states refuse to vote because their vote won't really change the electoral collage's vote. the voters don't have total control over an elector, so the whole election crisis could happen again. in conclusion, the electoral college may have worked when the colonies were small and the votes counted, but today the modern society doesn't appreciate its lace of constitutional rights. all we ase is for our right to vote to be given to us, so we can take part in our government. student",1,1,0.9990503984781797
"attitude is a powerful indicator of success. many successful people adopt a positive attitude to maximize their opportunities and reach their goals. for example, marianne williamson, a renowned author and teacher, believes that the most crucial ingredient for success is a positive attitude. she asserts that attaining a successful life is more about attitude than aptitude, and encourages people to live every moment with positivity and gratitude. other successful people, such as nba star dwyane wade, have proven that a positive attitude is necessary for true success. as a player for the miami heat, wade refused to give in to adversity and continually sought to remain positive in order to lead the team to victory. among the greatest talents, a positive attitude is essential for great successes. a positive attitude can help individuals become successful by teaching them to focus on their goals, leading them to find creative solutions to problems, and helping them stay motivated. it is important to remember that success is not a destination, but a journey. with the right attitude, success can be achieved despite the obstacles. therefore, attitude should always be considered an essential part of the success equation, and people should strive to remain positive in all situations.",0,0,2.732388038150116e-05
me as a student think that we should have at least a c because most students use sports to express their feeling out. sometimes if they don't get what they want they will just stop trying in school work or even homework. but in the other hand some other students will try harder so they can play or do what they love. so a c sounds good but a b sounds even better so students like me could try even harder and have a modification to so. so i say to the principal great gob and keep it up. when we are looking back and when we have a great job that we like we look back to middle school and say thank u for pushing us to max when it came down to doing work thank you.,1,1,0.9994479942395929

"since the invention of modern technology, such as video, computers, and the internet, there has been an enormous debate over the use of these innovations in the educational system. one side of the argument claims that these technologies offer improved methods for instructing students, while the other side believes that these technologies are distracting from real learning. after taking all the evidence into account, i agree that these technologies are distracting from real learning. when technology is used in the classroom, it can often be a distraction for students. for example, if a teacher is showing a video in class, there is always the risk of students losing focus and their attention turning to matters outside the lesson. furthermore, the use of computers in the classroom can also be distracting, as students can easily become side tracked by the multitude of possibilities open to them on the internet. this is something that is often seen in the classroom, with some students finding it difficult to stay focused and on task. another issue that arises with the use of technology in the classroom is that of cheating. when students have access to laptops and the internet they can easily use these to their advantage in exams and assignments. they are able to look up answers or pass their own notes to one another without the teacher knowing. this is especially true in online classes, where it is difficult for the teacher to keep track of what the students are doing. as such, this creates a situation where students are rewarded for cheating, rather than for actual learning. finally, using technology in the classroom can often lead to a lack of critical thinking. many of the videos and websites used in class are designed to be entertaining, rather than educational. as a result, students can become passive viewers and listeners, rather than actively engaging with the material and developing their own ideas. this can lead to students simply memorizing information, rather than actually thinking about the material in a meaningful way. in conclusion, while technology can offer schools improved methods for instructing students, there are many drawbacks to their use in the classroom. the use of these technologies can be distracting, open the door to cheating, and lead to a lack of critical thinking. for these reasons, i believe that these technologies are distracting from real learning.",0,0,0.00953361340126977
"when you ask for advice, do you ask more than one person. a recent study shows that at least 90 of people that asked more than one person for advice made better choices. when you ask more than one person for advice, i do believe that you will make better choices, because it can give you a gigantic understanding of other peoples opinions, it can help you for the rest of your life, and it can help others succeed in life too. getting to know others opinions can help you see the situation from a different perspective. in result, you can pick through them and find the one that sounds the best for the situation. although, if there is a bunch of people saying different things it can be hard to choose the best advice, but if people are saying the same thing as that is probably the best advice. knowing good advice could help you for the rest of your life. as a result it could help you get through life easier. it could also prevent stress, because if you're in a situation that you have already been in, then you would already know what to do in that situation. some advice could help you everyday like someone giving you advice on how to brush your teeth or what is a good way to put in contacts. good advice could be passed down for sentries and could help a lot of people. telling someone good advice can make it go into a loop of better choices. maybe multiple people told you advise about something, then you told your friend the advice, then your friend hears better advice, and it just continues. however, most of them will make your life much easier. when you ask more than one person for advice, i do believe that you will make better choices, because it can give you a gigantic understanding of other peoples opinions, it can help you for the rest of your life, and it can help others succeed in life too. asking more than one person for advice can give you better choices to make. it can give you a lot more choices to choose from, and it can be hard to choose one, but there is always a better choice.",1,1,0.9851753230316663

"according to the passage provided, americans are buying fewer cars and driving less, with a significant drop in miles driven per person since 2005. this trend aligns with president obama's goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn can help mitigate climate change. first and foremost, reducing car usage can help reduce carbon emissions and contribute to a cleaner, healthier environment. cars emit harmful pollutants such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, which can cause health problems like respiratory diseases and cancer. by limiting car usage, we can reduce the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that are released into the atmosphere. this, in turn, can help slow down climate change and create a more sustainable future for us and future generations. moreover, reducing car usage can have positive effects on our personal well being and wallets! according to the passage, americans are spending less money on gas and car maintenance as they drive less. this shift towards fewer cars and less driving can help individuals save money on fuel, maintenance, and parking. additionally, limiting car usage can promote a healthier lifestyle by encouraging physical activity like walking or cycling. by choosing alternative modes of transportation like public transportation or carpooling, we can reduce our carbon footprint and improve our overall health and well being. furthermore, reducing car usage can have societal benefits, such as reduced traffic congestion and less urban sprawl. less traffic on the road can reduce travel time and increase overall productivity. additionally, by promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can reduce our reliance on cars and create more pedestrian friendly cities. this can promote a sense of community and create more livable, thriving neighborhoods. in conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, from reducing carbon emissions to promoting a healthier lifestyle. by embracing this trend and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future for ourselves and future generations. so, let's choose to drive less, and make a positive impact on our planet!",0,0,3.1104186252663533e-06

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the electoral college. the electoral college is an outdated system that no longer reflects the will of the people. in the past four elections, the candidate who won the popular vote has lost the election. this is undemocratic and unfair to the majority of voters. the electoral college was created in the 18th century when the united states was a very different country. at the time, there were only 13 states and the population was much smaller. the electoral college was designed to give more power to the smaller states. however, the country has changed dramatically since then. there are now 50 states and the population is over 300 million people. the electoral college is no longer necessary and it is time to abolish it. there are many reasons why the electoral college should be abolished. first, it is undemocratic. in the past four elections, the candidate who won the popular vote has lost the election. this means that the majority of voters have been ignored. second, the electoral college gives more power to the smaller states. this is unfair because it means that the votes of people in small states are worth more than the votes of people in large states. third, the electoral college encourages candidates to focus on a few swing states and ignore the rest of the country. this is not in the best interest of the country as a whole. there are many ways to abolish the electoral college. one way would be to pass a constitutional amendment. another way would be to pass a law that allocates electoral votes proportionally by popular vote. i believe that the best way to abolish the electoral college is to pass a constitutional amendment. this would ensure that the electoral college is abolished permanently. i urge you to support abolishing the electoral college. it is an undemocratic and unfair system that no longer reflects the will of the people. thank you for your time and consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.029095326568375192
"mere senator, i am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular vote. as you know, the electoral college is a body of electors established by the united states constitution, constituted every four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president of the united states. the electors are chosen by each state, in a manner directed by the legislature thereof. each state's number of electors is equal to the number of seats it has in the u.s. house of representatives plus its two senators. the electoral college was created at the 1787 constitutional convention as part of a compromise between those who wanted popular elections for president and those who wanted the president to be chosen by congress. the electoral college system gives more power to smaller states, as each state has at least three electors two senators plus one representative . this means that a voter in a small state has more power than a voter in a large state. there are many reasons why i believe the electoral college should be abolished. first, it is undemocratic. the candidate who wins the popular vote should be the president. in four elections since 1824, the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election. in 2000, al gore won the popular vote by over 500,000 votes, but george w. bush won the election because he won the electoral college. second, the electoral college encourages candidates to focus on a few swing states. this is because candidates know that they can win the electoral college with a few large states. this means that candidates ignore the needs of voters in other states, who feel like their votes don't matter. third, the electoral college is not fair. it gives more power to voters in small states than voters in large states. this is because each state has at least three electors, regardless of its population. this means that a voter in a small state has more power than a voter in a large state. for these reasons, i believe the electoral college should be abolished. i urge you to support a national popular vote for president. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.09623154557763955
"driverless cars should not be something that is utilized this early on in time. driverless cars could be a high advancement in autonomous technology, however, the safety risks and other such cons outweigh the benefits. these vehicles do not have the evidence to support that they would definitely be one hundred percent safe when driving out and about the actual roads of life. granted that google does have test runs that have occured on controlled courses, but these can be very very different from actual public streets. driverless cars put our own people at risk solely because some would like to be lazy and not have to drive themelves. driverless cars pose a large threat to the general populace. these autonomous vehicles could potentially take hundreds of lives a year possibly thousands. although there may be some good things about switching to autonomous cars, there are many more bad. these cars are robotic, and not human operated. the human brain has a very efficient way of knowing when something is unsafe, and preventing that from happening. these cars couldn't notice if there were road traffic ahead, and if they were to continue driving, it could cause an accident. the same scenario goes for if there were someone walking across the road, a pedestrian. the idea of putting a camera into this car to watch the driver is ludicrous. privacy is a very big deal these days, and there aren't many who'd sacrifice that for anything. the fact that the driver would be continually watched whhile in the car would turn many people away instantly. judging by the risks involved in this vehicle, it may take a lot to get it approved, and if nothing else, you should try to have the people on your side. another issue of these unmanned vehicles is the limit of travel. what if somebody were wanting to go on a road trip? these vehicles surely only have a specific operating range, judging by the fact that they were said to be put in place of a taxi service. the efficiency isn't enough to outweigh all of these risks and con's. the safety risks and other such con's outweigh the benefits of driverless cars, however, they have the potential be a high advancement in autonomous technology.",1,1,0.9991668055306981

"first impressions are a fundamental part of human interaction, and they can greatly impact how people perceive and interact with each other. however, changing these initial perceptions can be challenging and difficult. in this essay, i will explore the reasons why first impressions are almost impossible to change and provide examples of how natural first impressions come to people, the role of the mind when forming first impressions, and how people are not prepared for the first impressions they experience. first impressions are often formed based on physical appearance, body language, and tone of voice. these initial perceptions can be influenced by a variety of factors, including cultural background, personal experiences, and societal expectations. for example, a person may form a negative first impression of someone based on their race or ethnicity, even if they have never met them before. similarly, a person may form a positive first impression of someone based on their physical appearance, even if they have never met them before. the role of the mind in forming first impressions is also important. our brains are wired to quickly process and categorize information, and this can lead to the formation of initial perceptions. when we meet someone new, our brains may quickly categorize them based on their appearance, behavior, and other cues. this categorization can be based on our past experiences and expectations, and it can be difficult to overcome. people are also not prepared for the first impressions they experience. we often form our first impressions based on limited information and incomplete context. for example, we may meet someone at a social event and form a first impression based on their behavior and appearance, without knowing their background or personality. this can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, as we may not accurately understand the person's intentions or motivations. in conclusion, first impressions are almost impossible to change because they are formed based on physical appearance, body language, and tone of voice, and are influenced by our past experiences, cultural background, and societal expectations. our brains are wired to quickly process and categorize information, and we are not always prepared for the first impressions we experience. it is important to be aware of these factors and to make an effort to form accurate and fair first impressions, in order to build positive and meaningful relationships with others.",0,0,4.005578088407197e-05

"the use of facial action coding system facs technology to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom could have both benefits and drawbacks. sn one hand, this technology may help teachers understand how their lessons are engaging students on an emotional level. if a teacher notices many students appear bored or confused during a lesson, facs could provide valuable feedback to improve instruction methods. it could also assist teachers in identifying students who are struggling emotionally but may not express it otherwise. this type of technology could help teachers provide better emotional support to students. however, constant monitoring of students' facial expressions with facs also raises privacy and behavioral issues. students may feel uncomfortable knowing their emotional reactions are being surveilled and analyzed in real time. this could increase anxiety and discourage natural emotional responses during class. students should feel free to focus internally on learning without worrying about expressions being screened. additionally, identifying emotions through facial expressions alone may not provide full context and could result in misinterpretations. a student's expression may not accurately reflect how they internally feel about a lesson. overall, while facs technology aims to give teachers useful insights, its continuous use in the classroom to monitor students risks invading privacy and altering natural classroom behaviors. teachers could benefit from occasional voluntary emotional checking with students, but constant facial monitoring goes too far. more traditional methods of teacher student communication are generally preferable to validate a student's emotional experience in school. if used sparingly and with consent, this technology may offer value, but broader application could do more harm than good.",0,0,0.00027655726279060083

"venus is the second planet from the sun in our solar system and is sometimes referred to as earth's sister planet. while earth is often called the blue planet due to its oceans and abundance of life, venus is known as the hot planet because of its extremely high surface temperatures. with an average temperature of around 872 f 467 c , venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. the high temperatures on venus are due to its extremely dense atmosphere, which is made up primarily of carbon dioxide. this thick atmosphere acts like a greenhouse, trapping heat from the sun and creating a runaway effect, resulting in temperatures that are much higher than earth's. venus' atmosphere also makes it incredibly difficult for spacecraft to land and explore its surface. despite the challenges of exploring venus, several missions have been conducted to gather data and learn more about this fascinating planet. one such mission was the venera series of probes, which were sent to venus by the soviet union between 1961 and 1984. these probes were able to withstand the harsh environment of venus and provided valuable insight into the planet's surface and atmosphere. recently, nasa's magellan spacecraft orbited venus from 1990 1994 and mapped the planet's surface using a radar system, which allowed scientists to create the first detailed maps of venus' surface. additionally, several other spacecraft have flown by venus, gathering information about its atmosphere and surface. as technology improves and our understanding of venus deepens, future missions to explore this planet may become more possible. scientists are interested in studying venus to learn more about earth's history and how other planets might be habitable. with its unique and extreme conditions, venus continues to captivate our curiosity and inspire exploration.",0,0,0.005616779920122122

"as technology advances, the use of artificial intelligence ai in the medical field is becoming increasingly popular. ai has already been used to diagnose cancer and other diseases with accuracy equal to or better than that of human physicians. in addition, ai based systems are being explored for use in patient care, such as providing personalized treatments or even predicting medical events like heart attacks. as beneficial as these applications may be, ethical considerations must also be taken into account when using ai in medicine. the most pressing concern is that patients privacy could potentially be compromised by giving machines access to their data without consent. another ethical issue involves fairness currently available ai algorithms are not neutral but are often biased towards certain demographics due to cultural preferences or economic standing. this problem can affect both diagnosis and treatment decisions if certain groups receive inaccurate results based on those biases. additionally, there is a risk of unintended consequences if an algorithm makes errors it is difficult to predict how a machine might react if given incorrect information about a patient s health condition. despite these potential issues, many experts believe that the benefits outweigh the risks when it comes to utilizing ai in healthcare settings. by incorporating machine learning into decision making processes and introducing digital assistance tools for doctors and nurses, healthcare providers will have more time freed up from routine tasks so they can focus on providing quality care for their patients rather than spending hours entering data manually or searching through medical databases for relevant information . furthermore, advanced diagnosis capabilities enabled by ai can provide early detection for life threatening conditions such as cancers which was not possible before this technology existed. along with improved accuracy levels compared with human doctors and greater efficiency through automation techniques ,the advantages brought by integrating artificial intelligence with current present day practices make it very desirable option amongst modern day hospitals looking forward improving healthcare delivery services at lower costs while ensuring higher standards safety protocols. . . . therefore while taking necessary precautions against any malicious intent associated with artificial intelligence utilization ,it should nevertheless remain an important",0,0,2.004021873683686e-05

"online learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many schools offering distance learning options to students. while there are certainly benefits to attending classes from home, such as increased focus and the ability to study in a peaceful environment, there are also challenges that come with it. one of the biggest challenges of online learning is the lack of social interaction. when students attend classes from home, they may feel isolated and disconnected from their peers. this can be especially difficult for students who are new to a school or who are struggling to make friends. in addition, online learning can make it more difficult for students to build relationships with their teachers, which can be an important part of their academic success. another challenge of online learning is the potential for distractions. while attending classes from home can provide a more peaceful environment, it can also be more difficult to stay focused. without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may be more likely to procrastinate or get sidetracked. this can be especially challenging for students who are already struggling to stay on top of their work. despite these challenges, there are certainly benefits to attending classes from home. for some students, the ability to study in a peaceful environment can be a major advantage. in addition, online learning can be more flexible than traditional classroom learning, allowing students to study at their own pace and on their own schedule. this can be especially beneficial for students who have other commitments, such as jobs or family responsibilities. ultimately, the decision to attend classes from home or not is a personal one. it's important for students to carefully consider the pros and cons of each option and to choose the one that best fits their needs and goals. whether they choose to attend classes in person or online, students should always strive to do their best and achieve their full potential.",0,0,1.516078023311234e-08
"dear principal, i think that students should be required to do community service because helping others ws a good way to build character. down community service makes you feel good about yourself because you have helped accomplish something or make a needed change in your community. it ws good to help people that are less fortunate than you because wt shows you're caring and compassionate. helping people in the community well show students what other people have to go through and deal with, which well help them to be less selfish and not take so many things for granted. i think students should be required to do around 23 hours of community service annually because wf students have sports or other after school activities they might not have a lot of time to perform community service. i think every student ws perfectly capable of performing a couple of hours of community service. students should do a type of community service that helps a topic or idea that interests them. for example wf a student lakes animals they could volunteer at an animal shelter or wf the student enjoys cooking they could volunteer at a soup kitchen. students may think that performing a little community service won't help change the world at all, but even helping someone in a small way can make a bwg difference. helping your community well make students better, more admirable and more respected people. students who volunteer when they're young are more likely to continue volunteering when they're an adult. then when they get married or have children they can show them how good wt ws to perform community service. students should be required to do community service because i believe wt well help them become a better person. sincerely, student name",1,1,0.9605956903400006
"in the article making mona lisa smile the author describes about how a new technology called racial action coding system enables computers to identify humans emotions. i rather not be scanned by a computer to tell me my emotions. i don't think the racial action coding system is valuable. the first reason that i think we shouldn't have computer scanning are face because we need privacy. i wouldn't want a computer scanning me to see if i was happy, sad, tired, or mad. example of the computer testing someone she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. also, there's no need to know there emotions some people don't want you to. second reason is that i wouldn't want to pay for it. some students couldn't afford it. others could buy it but why would they are at school to learn not to know other peoples emotions. example what the emotion scanner would do if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. but if you from next ad will be i different. this shows me that you don't need it because all it shows your emotions an what kinds ads others ruff that could help you. there's no point for this if it not helping you with school activities. third reason is what's the point of having this. it does benefit a little bit by changing stuff the computer to change our mood. example of this according to the racial feedback theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. but rather than that it doesn't help us. it doesn't help us get good grades, doesn't show us what to do in class, and doesn't help your teachers either. so in this article making mona lisa smile where they other talks about computer showing your emotions isn't valuable to any school. the racial coding system is just showing your emotions not helping you in school. it's also probably very expensive some people couldn't afford it. that's why i think it's not valuable or needed in a school.",1,1,0.9997404608771644

"the face on mars, also known as the martian humanoid, has been the subject of intense speculation and debate in the scientific community for many years. the face on mars is a large rock formation located near the cydonia mensae region of the red planet. it was initially spotted by nasa's viking 1 spacecraft in 1976, and later by the mars global surveyor in 1998. many people believe that the face on mars is an artifact created by intelligent beings from another world or a long lost civilization that once inhabited mars. however, the scientific community has a different perspective on this fascinating feature on the red planet. the scientific explanation for the face on mars is that it is a result of natural geological processes. specifically, it is thought to be a mesa, a type of landform formed by erosion and weathering of rock over long periods of time. the shape and appearance of the face on mars are believed to be a coincidental resemblance to a human face, rather than an intentional creation. in addition to the geological explanation, there have been various other explanations proposed by researchers and the public over the years. these include the idea that the face on mars could be a natural formation that looks like a face, a hoax, an alien structure, a product of pareidolia the psychological phenomenon that causes people to see familiar patterns in random stimuli , or a combination of these factors. despite the various theories and speculations surrounding the face on mars, the scientific consensus is that the feature is a natural formation, not the result of intelligent design or an ancient civilization. while the mystery of the face on mars may never be fully resolved, it continues to spark the curiosity and imaginations of people from all around the world, making it an enduring enigma in the field of space exploration and extraterrestrial research.",0,0,0.010645964248859384
"setting high aims is essential in order to achieve our goals. it pushes us to work harder while giving us the motivation to strive for more. when we aim high, there is a greater potential for success because it allows us to dream bigger and reach higher. however, there is a risk of failure when we set our aims too high, either due to an unrealistic timeline or a task that is too complex. therefore, it is important to carefully consider the level of difficulty that exists in any goal setting process. on the other hand, if we set our aims too low, we can become complacent or lose motivation to continue striving for something more. we can also fail to recognize or take advantage of the opportunity that exists in front of us. therefore, it is important to challenge ourselves and find a healthy balance between aiming too high and too low. in conclusion, humans need to set their aims too high in order to achieve their goals. doing so can cause both risks and rewards depending on how difficult the goal is. consequently, it is better to find a balance between aiming too high and low in order to maximize success.",0,0,4.95641187331495e-07

"making mona lisa smile is an insightful article that discusses the potential use of the facial action coding system facs in interpreting students' emotional states in a classroom. facs, a revolutionary technology that decodes human emotions, has sparked interest in the world of art and technology. however, the article raises concerns about the effectiveness and value of applying this technology in educational settings. as a student, i believe that the human brain's natural ability to gauge emotions through facial expressions renders emotion detecting software unnecessary in the classroom. teachers already possess the ability to sense and respond to student emotions effectively. the deployment of emotion recognition software in classrooms raises significant privacy concerns. the facs system, while advanced in recognizing emotions like confusion or boredom, lacks the capacity to understand the underlying causes of these emotions. in a diverse classroom setting, students bring a myriad of personal experiences and emotions that may not be directly related to the classroom environment. the application of emotion detection technology in such a setting could lead to invasive scrutiny of students' private emotional states, potentially exacerbating their distress. moreover, the implementation of personalized emotion detecting computers for each student would entail significant financial investments, making it an impractical solution for most educational institutions. the potential benefits of personalized learning experiences through emotion detection technology are overshadowed by practical and financial constraints. while computers equipped with facs could adapt teaching methods in real time to maintain student engagement, this raises questions about the feasibility of such an approach in group settings, where constant adaptation could disrupt the learning process for other students. in conclusion, as students, we need to embrace the value of human teaching over technological intrusion. while the concept of computers understanding and responding to human emotions is fascinating, its application in educational settings raises significant privacy concerns and practical constraints. the article emphasizes the importance of human centric teaching methods and the need to approach technological integration in education with caution and respect for privacy. as we progress into the age of technology, it becomes crucial to remember the value of human touch in education, a realm where emotional understanding and connection are paramount.",0,0,0.00019341792030559503
"the facial action coding system facs is a recent innovation in facial recognition software. it can deciper what a perosn may be feeling by analysing muscle movements and facial structure. while the technological impact of facs is revolutionary, can a sytem like it be used in schools to give insight into the emotions of a student? the value of facs in schools has the ptoential to become great, but as of now, facs still has many challenges to face in order for it to become a practical and valuable part of the education sytem. currently, facs can only recognize ...six basic emotions happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness... . while this abilty is a great acheviment, facs would have to be able to read many more expressions, such as confusion, boredom, or understanding to become useful in a classroom enviornment. if implemented in its current state, facs might look at each student's face and would be able to pinpoint only the happy or suprised students, but typically, the happy students are not be the ones who need help. without the capabilities to recognize more emotions, facs would serve little purpose in this setting. the artical also states that your at home pc can't handle the algorithms used to decode mona lisa's smile. many school comtuters are out of date and wouldn't be able to run facs either. so, in order to correctly use it, a school would have to spend large amounts of money to purchase machines with the computing power to run facs, an investment that may not pay off for years. this expense would only be made greater by the cost of the software itself. so, while the facial action coding sytem has the ability to become an integral part of the education sytem, with its current capabilities, it would seem that facs is not yet ready to assume the role of a valuable tool in classrooms arcross the country.",1,1,0.6700516711855785

"i believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. road knowledge allows a person to be more well rounded and understand different aspects of a topic. it also allows a person to be more flexible and able to learn new things. for example, a person who specializes in math may be able to understand and appreciate poetry, music, and other fields of study related to math. another example of how broad knowledge can be advantageous is when it comes to finding a job. a person who specializes in accounting may be able to find a job in accounting, but may not be able to find a job in marketing or engineering. a person who has broad knowledge of different fields may be better able to find a job in any of those fields. there are also many benefits to being well rounded. it can make a person more interesting and engaging to others. it can also make a person more well rounded when it comes to debating or discussing ideas. furthermore, it can even make a person more knowledgeable and better informed when it comes to making decisions. in conclusion, i believe that it is important to have broad knowledge of different academic subjects. this allows a person to be more versatile and able to learn new things. it also allows a person to be more interesting and engaging to others.",0,0,1.465027618527138e-05

"a letter to my principle i think students shouldn't have cells phones at school because it's a distraction to all the students. but it will be different if the students were just a little quiet with the cell phones, but instead they decide to bring drama to the schools. cell phones are the number one reason why fights are getting started at schools around the country. if they didn't have cell phones the percentage of fighting and arguing will be decreased. also, there's another reason i think they should ban the cell phones because if we were to use our cell phones in class the only thing that would happen is that no one will learn anything but how to talk on the cell phone, and how to text on the cell phones and that's mainly the problem that we are still having to today. next, is the drama it sometimes causes it can ruin a friendship or even a marriage it can be that serious. but to lose a husband or a wife a family mme a best friend over some stuff like that is really childish, and it needs to stop before it gets out of hand. so that's it for why i think ie shouldn't have cell phones at school !",1,1,0.9994546238989948
"staying busy the ga to personal success as an 8th grader, i've learned that staying busy is crucial for personal success. when we're constantly engaged in activities, whether it's schoolwork, extracurriculars, or personal projects, we're more likely to achieve our goals and reach our full potential. in this essay, i'll explore the advantages of staying busy and the dangers of being idle, and how actively pursuing our goals can lead to positive results. firstly, staying busy helps us develop time management skills. when we have a lot on our plates, we learn how to prioritize tasks, set deadlines, and balance different responsibilities. these skills are essential for success in any area of life, whether it's academics, career, or personal relationships. by learning how to manage our time effectively, we can avoid procrastination and make the most of our time, leading to better grades, more productive work, and stronger relationships. secondly, staying busy keeps us motivated and focused. when we're constantly working towards a goal, whether it's a project, a test, or a personal challenge, we stay motivated and engaged. we're more likely to push ourselves to work harder and achieve more, which can lead to a sense of accomplishment and self confidence. on the other hand, when we're idle and not challenging ourselves, we can easily fall into a rut of complacency and apathy, which can lead to a lack of motivation and a sense of purposelessness. thirdly, staying busy can help us develop new skills and interests. when we're constantly learning and trying new things, we can discover hidden talents and passions, and develop new skills that can benefit us in the long run. for example, joining a sports team or club can help us develop teamwork and leadership skills, while volunteering can help us develop empathy and compassion. by staying busy and exploring new activities, we can broaden our horizons and discover new areas of interest that can lead to a more fulfilling life. however, there are also dangers of being idle. when we're not challenging ourselves or staying engaged, we",0,0,3.672358393859521e-07
"dear principal, helping others and our community is a very important matter, but some of the people i associate with disagree. should they be required to perform community service, or not? i believe that benefiting others by providing a service to the community is a great and honorable achievement. all students at our school should be doing community service and benefiting society. to further explain my opinion, i will provide an example. my friend does not think that he should pick up any litter that is not his that is on the ground. while my other friend cannot stop picking up the smallest bit of trash in her gated community. she is providing a service to her community and the animals and insects that live in her area. it is important for those animals not to eat or consume any of the litter left on the ground we walk on. therefore, it is important to those animals to stay alive and be healthy because she picks up the trash and disposes of it in the proper way. to conclude, community service at our school would benefit students and prevent a dirty campus, tripping, and lazy students. if every student in our school had as much determination, persistence, and concern as my friend, our school would be a great learning environment. thank you for your consideration. sincerely, student name",1,1,0.8227510844496115

"limiting car usage for a sustainable future road transportation plays a vital role in modern society, allowing for efficient movement of people and goods. however, excessive reliance on private vehicles comes with numerous economic, environmental, and public health costs that diminish the sustainability of our transportation systems. by limiting unnecessary car use through various measures, we can work to reduce these negative impacts and build a more environmentally friendly transportation network for the future. one of the major issues caused by excessive car usage is traffic congestion and the resulting economic losses. ms more cars crowd our roads each day during commuting hours, traffic jams become longer and more frequent. this wastes people's time and causes productivity losses estimated in the billions for many countries. reducing single occupancy vehicle trips through policies promoting public transit, cycling, walking and ride sharing can help ease congestion. with fewer cars on the road during rush hours, people spend less time stuck in traffic and more time engaging in economically productive activities. in addition to congestion, our heavy reliance on gas guzzling cars has major environmental consequences. transportation accounts for roughly 25 of greenhouse gas emissions globally, with personal vehicles being a leading culprit. by driving less and shifting trips to nonmotorized modes when possible, individuals can help lower their carbon footprint and reduce air pollution in cities. over the long run, lower car usage may also lessen society's dependence on fossil fuels as alternatives like renewable energy powered public transit become more viable. with less pollution from vehicles on roads and in the atmosphere, public health stands to benefit as well through fewer respiratory illnesses. in summary, limiting unnecessary car trips through individual behavior changes as well as supportive policies can deliver worthwhile economic, environmental and public health returns for communities. m more balanced multimodal transportation system with reduced car dependency offers a promising path towards a sustainable future. citizens play a role through choices that diminish congestion and emissions from personal vehicles on our roads.",0,0,0.00013346914116669614

"dictionaries have long been an essential tool for language learners, and with the advent of technology, electronic dictionaries e dictionaries have become increasingly popular. however, some teachers worry that the overuse of e dictionaries may have more disadvantages than advantages for english learning. in my opinion, i agree with this view. to begin with, overusing e dictionaries may lead to a lack of spelling ability. in english, there are many words that may look similar but have different spellings and meanings. for example, the words affect and effect are often confused by language learners. when using e dictionaries, they may just type in the word they want to look up, without paying attention to the spelling. as a result, they may not be able to recognize the correct spelling of the word when they see it again in the future. furthermore, e dictionaries may also cause language learners to be less motivated to learn new words. instead of memorizing the words, they may just look them up in the dictionary. this can be especially true for those who are not very motivated to learn english in the first place. in this case, e dictionaries may actually become a hindrance to their learning progress. finally, using e dictionaries may also lead to a lack of understanding of the words. when using a traditional dictionary, language learners need to read through the definition and the example sentences to understand the word. but with an e dictionary, they may just look at the definition and not bother to read the example sentences. as a result, they may not have a full understanding of the word and it's usage in sentences. in conclusion, i believe that overusing e dictionaries may have more disadvantages than advantages for english learning. it may lead to a lack of spelling ability, a lack of motivation to learn new words, and a lack of understanding of the words. therefore, it is important for language learners to use e dictionaries in moderation and also to use traditional dictionaries to supplement their learning.",0,0,6.0587508359803696e-05
"dear state senator, i am writing to express my opinion on the matter of the electoral college and whether it should be abolished in favor of electing the president by popular vote. as a 9th grade student, i have been studying the history and function of the electoral college and have come to the conclusion that it is time for a change. the electoral college was established over 200 years ago as a compromise between those who wanted congress to choose the president and those who wanted the people to elect him directly. however, the system has faced criticism for its potential to cause confusion and for not always reflecting the popular vote, as seen in the 2000 election. critics argue that it is outdated, unfair, and can lead to disasters like faithless electors or a tie in electoral votes, which would throw the election to congress. one of the main arguments in favor of the electoral college is that it protects state interests and federalism. however, this defense is increasingly seen as inadequate. the system's origins, tied to concessions to slaveholders and assumptions about public information access, are no longer relevant. in today's society, information is readily available to the public and state interests can be represented in other ways. on the other hand, direct elections would be a more equitable and straightforward method of electing the president. it would reflect the popular will more accurately and avoid the possibility of a candidate winning the presidency without receiving the most votes. this system would also eliminate the possibility of faithless electors and ties in electoral votes, which could lead to a political crisis. some argue that direct elections could lead to recounts and controversies, but these can be avoided with proper voting systems and regulations. additionally, the concern about third party candidates is not a valid reason to keep the electoral college, as they can still participate in direct elections. in conclusion, the electoral college is an outdated system that no longer serves its intended purpose. it is time for a change to a more equitable and straightforward method of electing the president, such as direct elections by popular vote. i urge you to consider the abolition of the electoral college and the implementation of direct elections for the presidency. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.0001628734044274957

"while the mysterious formation known as the face on mars certainly captures people's imaginations, the evidence clearly shows that it is a product of natural geological processes rather than artificial construction. the face is located within the colonia region of mars, an area containing diverse landforms sculpted slowly by wind and weather over millions of years. on of the primary claims supporting a natural origin is the lack of detailed, identifiable features on would expect from an intentional sculpture. upon closer examination by orbiting spacecraft with more advanced cameras, the vague warlike indentations and other shadow patterns that give the appearance of a face from afar disappear into nondescript hills and rocks. if it www truly a enormous status, there should by wwlldwfinwd lines and contours visible when at high resolution. instead, the formation matches the uneven, ambiguous characteristics of randomly crowd terrain. additionally, surrounding landforms provide context that the face is continuous with the natural landscape. the article notes there arw similarly configured hills dotted across the area without discernible shapes. scientists also point to geological features like mesas, buttes and other unformed land masses to argue the face was carved over won by windblown dust, rather than instantly produced by design. this contextual clubs indicate the area evolved gradually through environmental war rather than instantaneous creation. in conclusion, while the face on mars superficially resembles a sculpted face from some angles, a careful analysis of the preponderance of evidence points to a natural origin consistent with the normal geological processes known to operate on mars. though intriguing to imaging as a sign of extraterrestrial visitation, occam's razor suggests the most simply explanation is usually the right on that winds and weather, not sentient hands, arw responsible for shaping this now famous martian landform. without clear proof of artificiality, the hypothesis that it is a natural accident of erosion remains most plausible.",0,0,0.009794487549212446

"i dont think we should keep the electoral college. i think we should abolish it. my reason is because we are not doing what we said we were going to do back when we signed the constitution. we said that we were going to let the people vote for who was going to govern us. it's not fair to the people if they're wasting their time. i think that it isn't fair to the people of america that they dont get to really pick the president of the u.s. i think that people should vote for the president not for slate of electors. i also dont think it's fair that sometimes their vote counts and sometimes it doesn't. what if the government would have pick the president back in the 1960's? we would probably be still having marches against segregation and marches for voting rights. i know that the electoral college has some benefits, like avoiding the problems of election in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast . like in 1968 nixon had 43 percent of the popular vote. also in 1992 clinton had 43 percent of the popular vote as well. the run off elections come with a extreme amount of pressure. but it really complicates the process of the presidental election. however, the pressure is reduced by the electoral college. on the other hand some states like california and texas's votes have no effect at that point. voters in the presidental election are people that want their vote to count. but we're not letting that vote count if we let the electoral college vote for us and choose who the president is. so we should just let the peolpe vote who the want.",1,1,0.9979523278418299
"i believe that the statement made by churchill holds true, and i can see why he would say it. failure is an inevitable part of life, and it is important to learn from it. in my own experience, i have found that every time i fail, i learn something new. for example, when i was in high school, i struggled with my english class. i would often get low grades on assignments and tests, and my teacher would always give me feedback on what i was doing wrong. at first, i felt discouraged and frustrated, but i decided to keep trying. i spent extra time studying and practicing, and i even sought help from my teacher and tutors. over time, i began to see improvements in my grades. i learned how to write better essays and how to structure my thoughts more effectively. i also learned how to manage my time better and prioritize my tasks. by the end of the semester, i had improved my grades significantly, and my teacher even complimented me on my progress. i think that the key to success is to never give up, even in the face of failure. it is important to keep working hard and to keep learning from your mistakes. by doing so, you can turn your failures into stepping stones on the path to success. so, i agree with churchill's statement and i believe that it is important to never give up, even when things get tough.",0,0,0.00030163977031947176
i personally think it's a good idea because students can become friends and be more social. i also think students should not be forced to join a sport or a club. im in between it being a good or bad idea and a lot of people like sports and clubs. im going to disagree because students should choose what they want to do whether its join a club or even play a sport. most of the time students don't want to join either because they don't have time or they just aren't into it. i know more people probably like sports a little more than clubs only because they actually like what their playing or their doing it to be popular. you also have games to worry about and i know that the players are nervous before the games. clubs are just something to do if your bored and want to join something and their for fun and tears nothing to worry about. a few people i know are already popular or have popular friends and they do sports to probably stay popular. sports help you for the real world like a tennis player or a nba basketball player.,1,1,0.9920747482902176

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the electoral college and electing our president by popular vote. the electoral college is an undemocratic system that gives more power to voters in some states than others. in the 2016 election, for example, hillary clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, but donald trump won the electoral college and became president. this is just one of many examples in which the electoral college has resulted in a president who did not win the popular vote. there are many reasons why the electoral college should be abolished. first, it is undemocratic. the very idea that someone can become president without winning the popular vote is absurd. in a democracy, the person who gets the most votes should win. second, the electoral college is unfair. it gives more power to voters in small states than voters in large states. this is because each state gets a certain number of electoral votes, regardless of its population. this means that a voter in a small state has more power than a voter in a large state. third, the electoral college encourages candidates to focus on a few swing states. this is because these states are the ones that can decide the election. candidates ignore the needs of voters in other states, because they know that these voters will not decide the election. fourth, the electoral college is a relic of the past. it was created in the 18th century, when the united states was a very different country. the electoral college was designed to protect the interests of small states, but it is no longer necessary. i urge you to support abolishing the electoral college and electing our president by popular vote. this would be a step towards a more democratic and fair system of government. thank you for your time. sincerely, your came",0,0,0.017451302426425452

"the face is just another natural landform, no matter how weirdly shaped. odd shaped landforms can be made through wind erosion. wind erosion can occur on any landform, and the outcome can be any shape. if it was not eroded, the planet could just have a landform different from what we have on earth. just because there is an oddly shaped landform on another planet does not mean that it was alien made. much about mars is undiscovered. this can mean that there are odd landforms which have not yet been discovered. some of these landforms have the possibility of being shaped like a face or the sillouhette of one. the indentations of the faces can also be craters from meteors hitting the landforms. because much is undiscovered, we must not jump to conclusions. natural landforms can take many shapes. they can range anywhere from cone shaped to face shaped. just because it resembles a face does not mean it is alien made. however, it could have been eroded to look similar to one. many things are capable of making face shaped landforms, not just aliens, which we are not yet sure even exist.",1,1,0.9458600560146706

"the league of nations, the united nations, and pele's accomplishments are all examples of successes and failures. the league of nations, founded after world war i, was intended to prevent future wars through diplomacy and cooperation between nations. however, it was ultimately considered a failure due to its inability to prevent world war ii and other conflicts. on the other hand, pele, one of the greatest soccer players of all time, achieved numerous successes throughout his career, including winning three world cup titles and scoring over 1,200 goals. his accomplishments are a testament to the power of hard work, dedication, and talent. in terms of space exploration, there have been numerous failed launches, including the challenger and columbia space shuttle disasters. these failures were due to a variety of reasons, including technical issues and human error. however, despite these failures, space exploration continues to be a driving force for scientific discovery and technological advancement. some argue that failure is an essential part of success. without failure, we would not learn from our mistakes and improve. in fact, many successful individuals, such as thomas edison and j.k. rowling, have attributed their success to their ability to learn from failure. winston churchill's words, success is not final, failure is not fatal it is the courage to continue that counts, reflect the importance of perseverance in the face of failure. churchill, a successful prime minister and statesman, understood that failure is a natural part of life, but it is how we respond to it that defines our character. in conclusion, success and failure are intertwined, and both are essential for growth and progress. while the league of nations may have been considered a failure, it paved the way for the united nations, which continues to play a vital role in international relations. pele's accomplishments are a testament to the power of hard work and dedication, and the importance of learning from failure. space exploration, despite its failures, continues to drive scientific discovery and technological advancement. finally, winston churchill's words remind us that perseverance in the face of failure is what truly defines success.",0,0,0.00040616841236872304

"i am in favor of the continued operation of zoos as they play a vital role in conservation and education. here are my reasons firstly, zoos provide a safe haven for endangered species that may be at risk of extinction due to various factors such as habitat destruction or poaching. in these controlled environments, zoos can help to protect and preserve these animals by providing them with a safe place to live, breed, and thrive. for example, the san diego zoo has been successful in breeding giant pandas, which are an endangered species. secondly, zoos serve as important educational institutions that teach people about different animal species and their habitats. they offer visitors the opportunity to see and learn about animals that they may not have the chance to encounter in the wild. additionally, zoos can help to raise awareness about conservation efforts and the threats facing various species. for instance, the bronx zoo in yew york has a program called wildlife conservation society which is dedicated to saving wildlife and wild places worldwide. lastly, zoos also contribute to research and scientific advancements in the field of animal behavior and biology. by observing animals in captivity, researchers can gain valuable insights into their behavior, physiology, and genetics. this information can then be used to develop better conservation strategies and improve the care of animals in captivity. in conclusion, while there are certainly some ethical concerns surrounding the operation of zoos, i believe that the benefits they provide in terms of conservation, education, and research outweigh these concerns. as long as zoos continue to prioritize the wellbeing of their animals and focus on their role in preserving and protecting endangered species, they should be allowed to continue operating.",0,0,2.890150973155236e-06
"cell phones are one of the biggest new technologies, and a great way to communicate. from your phone you can access your email, make calls to people around the world or send a simple text message. you can also download music, and play games. but still the question is. should kids be allowed to use them during school? yes, i believe that kids should be allowed to use their phones during lunch, or whatever free time they have. during class, not so much. if that was the case, kids would be cheating on homework, assignments and tests. also, the kids would not be as focused on their schoolwork as they should be. but, during free time they should be allowed to have them. for example. lets say that a kid has a basketball game after school and when he gets to school, he finds out he left his shoes at home. during the next free time or lunch he could make an urgent call to his mom or dad so he could get them before the game starts. also, kids need social time. it's what they do. socialize. some kids maybe have friends from other cities, or towns. cell phones are a great way to talk to your friends if you don't see them on a daily basis. lastly, students need to use cell phones. it's part of our lives here in the twenty first century. sometimes you just need a little down time to talk to someone, listen to music, or just play games. that's why i think cell phones should be allowed during lunch or free time.",1,1,0.9737843879502398

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my support for changing from the electoral college system to a popular vote for electing the president of the united states. while the electoral college was established by the founders with the aim of creating a buffer between the population and the selection of the president, in the modern era it no longer seems to serve this purpose effectively and can undermine principles of democracy. one of the main arguments against a popular vote is that it could result in candidates only focusing on population centers. however, the electoral college system today already incentives candidates to focus campaign efforts and promises on a handful of swing states. according to federal election commission data, presidential candidates spent over 95 of campaign visits and ad money in just six states in 2016. a popular vote could actually encourage candidates to build broader coalitions by appealing to a wider range of ideological beliefs. it may also increase voter turnout nationally as more citizens, regardless of state, will feel their votes directly impact the outcome. it is also argued that the electoral college helps provide a definitive outcome. however, we have seen close national popular vote victories not result in electoral college victories, as with al gore in 2000 and hillary clinton in 2016. this undermines the legitimacy of the election in the eyes of millions who voted opposed to the outcome. a popular vote that aligns with the national preference could strengthen our democratic process. while concerns over sparsely populated states must be addressed, the needs and voices of all americans could still be respected through the senate representation. in conclusion, while the electoral college may have served purposes in the past, in today's highly polarized political climate it can discourage national consensus building and participation. i believe changing to a popular vote system would make our democratic process more equitable and respected at home and abroad. this is an important issue, and i hope you will consider supporting a popular vote reform to help modernize how we elect the leader of our country. thank you for your consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.0019508590311101974

"dear principal smith, i am writing to you regarding the decision about whether to require ass students to perform community service. while helping the community is certainly important, i do not think making it mandatory is the best approach. there are a few key reasons for my position. firstly, requiring community service risks taking away students' freedom to choose how to spend their own time. not ass students have the same interests or passions, and forcing them into volunteer work may foster resentment rather than appreciation for service. some students need time for other commitments like jobs, sports, or caring for family members. community service is best when it comes from personas motivation rather than obligation. seconds, mandatory service may discourage deeper engagement with the causes students work for. when volunteering is a mandatory task to complete rather than a choice, students are less likely to fees invested in the work or understand its importance. surface serves engagements do little to help those in need or build empathy in students. truly meaningful service stems from a student's own desire to help their community. instead of making it a requirement, i think a better approach is to promote opportunities for voluntary community service and help students understand why it matters. recognizing student volunteers with awards or setters of recommendation for college could help inspire others to participate freely. leading by positive example, like having teachers perform service projects, may do more to create a culture of caring than policies of compassion. in conclusion, while the intent of required community service is understandable, i do not believe it is the most effective way to encourage students to become engaged, caring citizens. volunteering done out of personas choice is more likely to make a areas difference and stay with students song term. for these reasons, i do not think it should be mandatory for ass students. please set me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of my position. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.0014385662528105401

"character traits and influence as an eighth grade student, i have been exposed to various ideas and perspectives on how we develop our character traits and how they are influenced by others. in this essay, i wick analyze the perspectives of john lubbock, a renowned writer and thinker, and examine how our mindset and decisions shape our character and the people we surround ourselves with. john lubbock believed that character traits are not innate but are developed over time through our experiences and interactions with others. he believed that we have the power to shape our character by consciously choosing to act in certain ways and by surrounding ourselves with people who share our values. lubbock believed that by cultivating a positive mindset and setting goals for ourselves, we can become better people and achieve our fcc potential. in my opinion, our mindset plays a crucial race in shaping our character. our mindset refers to our attitudes, beliefs, and expectations towards ourselves and others. it influences how we perceive and respond to situations, and ultimately, how we behave. people with a positive mindset tend to be optimistic, resilient, and proactive, which those with a negative mindset tend to be pessimistic, passive, and secfcriticac. our mindset also shapes the kind of people we surround ourselves with. we tend to gravitate towards people who share our values and beliefs, and who have a positive mindset. our decisions and actions also play a significant race in shaping our character. our decisions and actions reflect our values, beliefs, and priorities. they have consequences that can be positive or negative, depending on the choices we make. for example, if we consistently make decisions that prioritize our own needs over those of others, we may develop a selfish character trait. on the other hand, if we consistently make decisions that prioritize the wellbeing of others, we may develop a compassionate character trait. motivation and having goals in life can also shape our character. when we have clear goals and a sense of purpose, we are more likely to take action towards achieving them. this can head to positive outcomes, such as personal growth, achievement, and fulfillment. however, if we back motivation or have unclear goals, we may become stagnant or aimless, leading to negative outcomes, such as frustration, disappointment, and disses",0,0,1.0850815677944267e-05
"i believe that the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is sort of valuable. it can either help someone or not. but it doesn't hurt to try. to begin with, i say sort off because, for one, you never know what a person is going through. if the computer can tell someones emotion why not see how they're feeling. if they're sad or depressed maybe you can help them in someway. but also, people might not want you to know how they're feeling. so using the computer's app, that is kind of disrespecting them in a way because they dont want you to know their emotions. also, i still think it is valuable because like a i said if they're sad you can help them. even if they don't want you to know, you can still help them secretly though. they will recieve help without even knowing that they're getting help. little do people know, alotof people who are sad tend to smile the most and just look happy. so, honestly i do feel like it is very valuable, people should use it. but not just anyone, maybe like doctors or specialist. i think specialists should be the ones to use them because they can be the ones to help people and they actually know how to do so. in the passage it talks about how in some people it is easy to tell by their face expression what they are feeling. but sometimes it is hard, and i agree. that is why i do think it is very valuable to use the computer. lastly, i do think its useable. it helps by letting us know who is depressed or stuff like that. but like i had said, i belive it should only be doctors using it and not just anyone because people and kids are immature and we would not want others to make them feel worse.",1,1,0.9957363526587449

"in today's digital age, electronic dictionaries have become a ubiquitous tool for language learners. while some argue that they offer numerous advantages, others believe that their overuse can have a detrimental effect on students' language skills. in my opinion, i agree that excessive reliance on dictionaries can lead to a decline in spelling ability, and i will explain why in the following paragraphs. firstly, dictionaries can be a double edged sword for language learners. on the one hand, they provide quick and easy access to definitions, synonyms, and translations, which can be helpful for students who are struggling with vocabulary. on the other hand, they can also create a sense of dependency, leading students to rely on them too heavily and neglect their own spelling skills. for instance, if a student is unsure about the spelling of a word, they may immediately turn to their dictionary instead of trying to spell it out themselves. over time, this can lead to a decline in their spelling ability, as they become less confident in their own knowledge and more reliant on technology. secondly, dictionaries can also be a distraction for students during class. instead of focusing on the lesson and actively engaging with the material, students may be tempted to use their dictionaries to look up words or phrases that they don't understand. this can disrupt the flow of the class and prevent students from fully immersing themselves in the language. moreover, it can also lead to a lack of critical thinking skills, as students may become too reliant on their dictionaries to provide them with answers instead of thinking for themselves. in conclusion, while dictionaries can be a useful tool for language learners, their overuse can have negative consequences for students' spelling ability and critical thinking skills. therefore, it is important for teachers to encourage students to use dictionaries in moderation and to develop their own language skills through practice and active engagement with the material. by striking a balance between technology and traditional learning methods, students can achieve a more well rounded and effective language education.",0,0,5.628531904069307e-08

"i proper name think that the electoral college should be abolished. how would you feel if you were running for president and only 1 party got to pick the winner ? that just seems unfair and unorganized to me. for someone to have to go through an entire process just to pick president, is way more far than what it could be. i don't tank it's okay for state legislatures to have a says in who should be president should be because for them to try to pick it for themselves without the help of the people which is who really matters. the people should have just as much a says in whom the president and vise president should be. well they do but i don't think the state parties should have anything to do with the votes. for 1 the collage or process its self is unnecessary just for someone to cast a vote, when they could really check who they want to vote for on a piece of paper or something. sure that would take a lot of time just to count but i think that's far more organized than for everyone to go through a process on a computer or something. according to the text the electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors .... that's too much voting going on for no reason. everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and it should be heard, because every little vote counts. i remember when i was in elementary school nd when election time came around they took the students in the library to vote even though we were not old enough to vote i can guarantee the votes that we cast made a difference even if it was just by 1 vote. but as i think abut it, the president is not just for the benefit of the congress and the state legislatures, he she is for the benefit of everyone. i think that the state parties wants to have a says in the votes just so they can feel important.",1,1,0.9999907862729319
"dear principal, helping out the community is always a good thing to do. some people like helping, but others don't. i understand that people are busy with other things and might not have time to help the community, but little things you do help. therefore, i think that the students should perform community service. if you have something else going on like sports for example, you could take a day off from them to help the community. some people don't even play sports because they can't afford it, so think how they feel. if the students helped out the community, i think the community would appreciate it, and be thankful that the kids took time out of their schedule to help them. community service doesn't take long, the longest it would take is a day. after you do community service you feel good because you know you helped people. even if theirs certain things you don't like doing for community service, there's many things that you could choose from. i know i would feel good if people helped me out, and the people you are helping will feel good too. as a principal you should encourage the kids to do community service. it will help them become better people. i mean i know, i'm a kid and i know doing community service isn't the most fun thing. i could be doing something better. no one likes doing service. after you get done with it, you do feel good inside and you know that you helped people have a better life. there's always little things that you could do to help out in the community. even recycling. you help out the community a lot doing that because you are cleaning our world. people should recycle more often and it would make our place cleaner and healthier to live in. we do community service in my school. we do it every year as a class. i think that even one day a year helps people out a lot. i would say that you should have your students do community service. it would help out everyone there, and they would be happy that you came to help them out. sincerely, student name",1,1,0.9986258851409763
"i think the facial coding system is valuable for students in a classroom because then it could recognize students emotions. a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored dr. huang predicts. then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, notes dr. huang. the facial coding system is a 3 d computer model of the face. eckmen, the creator of the facing coding system, classifies six basic emotions including, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and saddness. then, he associates them with characterisric movements of the facial muscles. for example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrows when you're surprised your orbicularis oris tightens your lips to show anger. the facial expressions for each emotion are universal, observes dr. huang, even though individuals often show varying degress of expression like not smiling as broadly . the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in a painted face of mona lisa. the software can even identify mixed emotions. this helps to know how students are feeling.",1,1,0.9315224471614935
"many advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. i disagree with this statement for a few reasons. first, some products are not actually meant to be as good as they seem in advertisements. for example, a car commercial may show a car driving through the mountains, but the car that is sold to the public may not be able to do that. the advertisement is meant to make the product look better than it is, so that people will want to buy it. second, sometimes products are not meant to be used in the way that they are shown in the advertisement. for example, a commercial for a new cell phone may show the phone being used underwater. however, the phone may not be able to be used underwater and may be damaged if it is. the advertisement is meant to make the product look better than it is, so that people will want to buy it. lastly, people are not always able to get the same results from products that they see in advertisements. for example, a shampoo commercial may show someone with very shiny and voluminous hair. however, not everyone will be able to get the same results from using that shampoo. the advertisement is meant to make the product look better than it is, so that people will want to buy it. in conclusion, i believe that many advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. however, there are a few reasons why this might not always be the case.",0,0,0.20542209923926602
"the american dream is an ideal that has captivated the hearts and minds of people for generations. it symbolizes a person s hope for achieving financial independence, safety, security, and personal fulfillment. although many believe that the concept of this dream originated in america during the 20th century when immigrants flocked to its shores seeking opportunity it can actually be traced back much farther in history. in fact, early settlers of what would become new england spoke often about their aspirations to live more abundantly than they had before. thus, the idea of the american dream was born. for those who pursue it today, the american dream is based on self determination and hard work two components necessary to achieve success regardless of one's background or situation. many segments of society have embraced this concept as a way to secure freedom from poverty or oppression however there are still some obstacles blocking access to realization such as inequality due to race or gender discrimination and lack of education opportunities among others issues facing disadvantaged populations in our nation. despite these setbacks however, individuals with ambition remain undeterred by challenges encountered along their journey towards fulfilling their vision for prosperity understanding that perseverance will lead them closer towards realizing that dream despite setbacks endured en route. achieving the american dream requires courage and resilience which means refusing compromise even when faced with intimidating odds only through dedication can we manifest our dreams into reality . . whether looking back at historic examples set by our forefathers who risked everything in pursuit of success or observing current day achievers conquering adversity while striving relentlessly towards accomplishing goals beyond imagination the legacy of the american dream continues onward inspiring countless individuals every single day!",0,0,0.0004131681143568508

"dear principle, i greatly disagree with you. many students struggle with keeping a c average, and it is considering a passing grade so why not let the ''pass'' on by and play sports. this also has upset any parents as for their kids are athletes but can't play for this reason. many schools around let their kids participate in school sports with a c average. this can also affect our athletics and how we perform their for some kids will not be able to participate. this also can affect how any students attend this school for the new rule. so it looks like the odds are stacking up against this despicable new rule. and its by opinion that this new rule is very unlikely to pass with the b.o.e. i think they will veto the rule as if they see all the odds against this new rule. i honestly really dislike this rule and so does any other people. also, some of the other activities can be helpful to us as in community service. so this rule can hard the school in any ways as in sports, community service hours, participation etc. that is why i disagree with you on this new rule as well as any other students and people do as well. sincerely, student name",1,1,0.9999008613416936
"dear principal, i believe no cell phones is the way to go. i believe this because students who use cell phones in school will be off task and no do there work. one reason why i think this is because the students need to get an education and n not worry about that text they just received. another reason i have that might convince you to listen to this is because if you follow up with this rule students in the school will stop worrying about phones and more about school. witch means better grades and behavior and also better testing scores. maybe even less drama because as you see there are many conflicts that come from texting and social net works because someone said something over a text message. so by not allowing this you could possibly prevent fights, and other harmful situations from happening. students also have all before school and after school even weekends to text, so it shouldn't be happening in school. if you were to let the students have their cell phones out and let them text, they wouldn't pay attention in class, not no what there doing, and get bad grades on important test and even homework. they also might not listen to the teacher when he or she is talking witch might aggravate them and become mad at the student. to finalize this statement i have to share with you, i would like to say if you consider this idea this could really change how the school runs and make things better than they were. so thank you for reading this, and hopefully you consider this idea for a better and brighter future. sincerely, student name",1,1,0.9999670075717172

"the debate of whether students should commit to a career path at an early age is one that causes fierce contention among parents and educators alike. on one hand, many argue that students should pe familiar with their career trajectory from a young age, in order to focus energy and resources on necessary skills and experiences. on the other hand, proponents of delayed commitment argue that it can pe limiting to make a single decision at a young age, without taking into account how life and experiences may influence career direction. one of the main arguments in favor of an early career commitment is that it allows students to maximize their potential by focusing their education on specific skills. by having a career goal in place, students can more effectively develop the appropriate skillet in order to equip themselves with the knowledge needed to pursue that career. an early career goal allows students to allocate their energies into relevant learning, rather than trying to tackle a road range of subjects in an effort to slowly discover their ideal career. conversely, some voice the argument that early commitment to a career can pe limiting for young people. it can pe difficult for a young person to make a career decision with the understanding and knowledge of the world that they have at that age. they may find that life experiences, or gaining more knowledge of the broader career paths have a significant influence on their ultimate career decision. additionally, the quickly evolving top market can make it difficult for students to decide on a particular career path that pest suits their interests and abilities, that will still pe in existence in the years to come. in conclusion, the decision to commit to a career at a young age should pe based on a full understanding of the pros and cons. while focusing on a clear career goal from an early age can enable students to maximize their potential, the potential limitations of making such a decision too soon should pe taken into account. ultimately, only by considering the impact of an early career commitment can students pe enabled to make a decision regarding a career path that pest suits their goals and ambitions.",0,0,3.217321236712394e-06

"the electoral college, as a part of the united states presidential election process, has been a controversial topic for many years. the question of whether or not the electoral college system works effectively can be examined from multiple angles. firstly, let's consider the historical context. the electoral college was established as a compromise between the election of the president by congress and a popular vote. this was a time when the country had just emerged from the american revolution and states had varying populations, which would have made a popular vote unfair. the founding fathers aimed to balance the interests of both the states and the people. secondly, the electoral college system is designed to ensure the president is chosen by an informed, diverse group of people, not just the general public. electoral votes are apportioned to each state based on its representation in congress, which means larger states like california have more votes than smaller states like wyoming. this system ensures that every state's interests are considered and not dominated by a handful of populous states. on the other hand, the electoral college system has been criticized for its potential to lead to a tyranny of the majority. since the electoral votes are apportioned to each state based on its representation in congress, this means that even if one candidate wins the popular vote in a state, they could still lose the electoral votes if they don't win the majority of those electoral votes in the state. for instance, in the 2016 presidential election, donald trump won the electoral college vote despite losing the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes. furthermore, the electoral college can lead to faithless electors, who are electors who do not cast their votes for the candidate that their state chose. although this is uncommon, it has happened, which undermines the principle of a direct connection between voters and their votes. in conclusion, the electoral college system does have its merits and flaws. while it ensures the representation of all states' interests, it can potentially lead to an unfair result if the majority vote doesn't correspond to the electoral votes. the controversy surrounding the electoral college highlights the importance of continuously evaluating and improving the democratic process to ensure fairness and accuracy in the election of the president of the united states.",0,0,0.00018073314588408436

"the electoral college system has been a controversial topic in american politics for many years. the primary function of the electoral college is to elect the president and vice president of the united states. the question is whether it works effectively in achieving this goal. the electoral college was designed to provide a compromise between the election of the president by the people directly and the election by state legislatures. the founding fathers wanted to balance power between the federal government and the states. the electoral college consists of electors who represent each state, with the number of electors proportional to the state's population. the candidate who wins a state's popular vote gets all that state's electoral votes, with the exception of nebraska and maine, which use a proportional system. the candidate who receives the required number of electoral votes, currently 270, wins the presidency. proponents of the electoral college argue that it ensures that the president is elected by a diverse group of people representing different interests across the country. it also prevents candidates from focusing solely on populous cities, as the electoral college gives equal weight to less populated areas. critics argue that the electoral college is outdated and can produce undemocratic results. they point out that a candidate can win the presidency without winning the popular vote, as happened in the 2016 election. this has led to calls for reforming or even abolishing the electoral college. in conclusion, while the electoral college serves its original purpose, it has its drawbacks. the question of whether or not it works effectively is subjective, as opinions on this matter vary. regardless, it is clear that the electoral college needs to be re evaluated in today's political climate, and it remains a subject of ongoing debate.",0,0,0.0017395434632816451

"sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student following someone else's agreement can have both beneficial and detrimental consequences when it comes to self growth and development. on one hand, it can be helpful to learn from others and gain new perspectives. for example, if a friend has a different way of thinking about a problem, hearing their perspective can help you see it in a new light and come up with a solution that you might not have thought of on your own. this can be especially helpful when working on a group project or when trying to solve a difficult problem. on the other hand, following someone else's agreement too closely can limit your own growth and development. when you only consider someone else's perspective, you might miss out on the opportunity to discover your own thoughts and ideas. this can be especially detrimental in subjects like science and math, where it's important to understand the underlying concepts and formulas in order to solve problems. if you're only relying on someone else's explanation, you might not fully understand the material and could struggle to apply it to real world situations. one example of this is when i was working on a science project with my group. my partner had a perfect idea for the experiment, but i didn't fully understand the concept behind it. i was too busy trying to follow their instructions that i didn't take the time to think about the science behind it. as a result, i struggled to explain the project to the class and didn't do as well as i could have on the presentation. in conclusion, following someone else's agreement can be helpful when it comes to learning new perspectives, but it's important to strike a balance between relying on others and trusting your own instincts. it's okay to seek help and guidance from others, but it's also important to take the time to think things through on your own and come up with your own ideas. by finding this balance, you can ensure that you're growing and developing in the best way possible.",0,0,0.0005159255701289364

"university education has always been a topic of debate. some people believe that the some purpose of university education is to prepare students for employment, while others argue that it has other functions. in my opinion, university education has multiple functions, and preparing students for employment is just one of them. firstly, university education provides students with an opportunity to gain knowledge and skills in a specific field. for example, a student studying medicine learns about the human body, diseases, and treatments. this knowledge is not only useful for employment but also for personal growth and development. similarly, a student studying literature gains knowledge about different cultures, perspectives, and historical events, which can broaden their understanding of the word. secondary, university education heaps students develop critical thinking and problem solving skills. through assignments, projects, and discussions, students learn to analyze information, evacuate arguments, and develop their own opinions. these skills are not only useful for employment but also for personal decision making and problem solving. thirdly, university education provides students with opportunities for personal growth and development. students learn to interact with people from different backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives. they also learn to manage their time, set goals, and work independently. these skills are essential for personal growth and development, and they can also be useful for employment. lastly, university education prepares students for employment by providing them with specific skills and knowledge required for their chosen profession. for example, a student studying engineering learns about design, construction, and maintenance of structures and machines. this knowledge is essential for employment in the engineering field. in conclusion, university education has multiple functions, and preparing students for employment is just one of them. university education provides students with an opportunity to gain knowledge and skills in a specific field, develop critical thinking and problem solving skills, grow personally, and prepare for employment. therefore, university education is essential for personal growth and development, as wear as for employment.",0,0,4.0681707755506606e-07

"schools shouldn't force students to do extracurricular activities because that can induce stress and not have time to spend with your family. on the other hand some people believe it's better in order for students to be academically inclined to do well in school. having students forced into extracurricular activities can lead to stress which can eventually impact students negatively. negative stress can lead to failing classes, bad house habits and suicide. for example stress leading to class failing can really have a big impact on a students life if they have to repeat a grade, it can possibly make it harder for them to graduate and even find a stable job. so if these bad impacts happen then society might just perish due to stress given off by forced extracurricular activities. stress really can lead up to fatal consequences if there's enough stress going around because of forced extracurricular activities. people usually do well if there is nothing that stresses them out but with forced extracurricular activities the stress will double and even triple in the size it was mentally before hand. forced extracurricular activities can also lead up to time spent with family decrease. forced extracurricular activities could take a significant amount of family time away impacting the students relationship with their family and those around. this could make a stable family unstable and make them argue often because the student isn't on the same page as the family due to family time loss from going to the forced extracurricular activity after school. this can also impact a students mental and emotional health for example there are many students with elderly people whom they cherish, they might have little time to live so time with them can have a major impact on their emotional health. but if time where taken away these students won't spend the amount of time they need with the elderly to be emotionally stable since the elderly might die any day. if this happens students might learn to associate school with bad things that keep you away from those whom you cherish deeply. forced extracurricular activities shouldn't exist due to reasons like stress and family time loss, which can mentally, emotionally and academically affect students due to extracurricular activities. this is why forced extracurricular activities shouldn't ever surface in this beautiful country we know as the united states.",1,1,0.9681314418205339
"though some may not want to admit it, parenting is one of the most difficult and complex jobs in the world. whether a person is a first time parent or has been raising children for years, it can be difficult to navigate all of the intricacies that come along with parenting. from making sure everyone gets enough sleep and eats nutritious foods to teaching them right from wrong and helping them become successful adults, there are many challenges that parents must face every day. one of the main roles of parenting is setting an example for their children. parents should strive to demonstrate positive behaviors such as respectfulness, empathy toward others, and honesty at all times so that their children learn these values early on in life. showing patience while teaching new skills or emphasizing good manners will help instill those same qualities into their growing kids so they can have strong foundations in which to build upon throughout life s journey. parenting also involves creating boundaries for behavior as well as providing structure and consistency when needed. having clear expectations set forth ahead of time helps ensure that kids understand what is expected from them in terms of house rules as well as academic performance or other areas like sports teams or clubs they may be involved with outside home life. consistency within this framework over time will create a safe environment where kids can grow but also know what consequences follow if certain lines are crossed too far outwardly by any members inside the family unit parents included . lastly, loving support always remains at the core foundation of any successful parent child relationship no matter how old your son daughter might be never forget this! listening openly without judgement allows kids to have space where they feel secure enough confide anything going on inside themselves during stressful moments through preteen years up until adulthood you need find ways show unconditional love even though things don't always go according planfor both parties involved. understanding each individual's needs through communication yields greater empathy among all parties allowing anyone express feelings freely",0,0,0.0017204725349120934
"the facial action coding system facs is a set of standardized facial expressions and corresponding muscle movements. it was developed by dr. carl herman hjertsso, a renowned swedish anatomist and physiologist, and later refined by dr. paul ekman, a leading american psychologist specializing in facial expressions and emotions. the facs consists of 43 distinct facial actions, each representing a specific emotion or feeling that can be expressed through the face. the facs has several applications, including psychology, animation and acting, as it allows researchers to study and understand the complexities of human emotions and expressions. it also helps animators create more lifelike and expressive characters, as they can accurately depict various emotions and facial movements. additionally, actors can use the facs as a tool to improve their understanding and portrayal of emotions. in summary, the facs is a comprehensive and widely recognized system of facial expressions, providing valuable insights into human emotions and their corresponding muscle movements. its use in psychology, animation, and acting continues to expand our understanding of the complexities of human emotions, making it essential for anyone interested in the study of human expression.",0,0,1.4604505408535494e-05
"dear senator, i am writing to express my opinion on the matter of the electoral college vs popular vote for the president of the united states. as a 6th grader, i have been learning about the different ways that the president is elected and the pros and cons of each method. firstly, i believe that the electoral college has its benefits. it ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election and that the president is elected by a broad coalition of states, rather than just the most populous ones. this helps to ensure that the president is accountable to voters in all states, rather than just those in the biggest ones. however, i also understand the argument for election by popular vote. it seems unfair that a candidate can win the presidency without receiving the most votes nationwide. this can lead to a situation where a candidate wins the presidency without having the support of the majority of voters. after reading the provided passages, i have come to realize that both methods have their flaws. the electoral college can lead to a situation where a candidate wins without receiving the most votes, as we saw in the 2000 and 2016 presidential elections. on the other hand, election by popular vote could lead to a situation where smaller states are ignored and the president is only accountable to voters in the biggest states. in my opinion, a combination of both methods could be the best solution. we could keep the electoral college, but have a system in place to ensure that the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide also wins the presidency. this would ensure that both smaller and bigger states have a voice in the election. i understand that changing the method of electing the president is a complex issue and there are many factors to consider. however, i believe that it is important to ensure that the president is elected in a fair and democratic manner. i urge you to consider my opinion and work towards finding a solution that benefits all americans. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.002039873129581471

"a talent i possess is the art of pranking people. it was inspired by a youtube creator who went out and performed pranks on people, which made me want to try them out for myself. my first prank was on my family, and i put a woppie cushion on their seat, which was both fun and entertaining. however, as i continued to prank them, the ideas started to become stale and unoriginal. to keep things interesting, i began to use my pranks in new and creative ways. for example, i once put a cockroach under a cookie, which scared a lot of people and was a successful prank. another one of my creative pranks was called valentines through the hand box, which involved cutting a large hole in a box and placing a hand inside, causing people to jump when they opened it. now, i use pranks more often, especially on teachers. in public, i will place a fake poop on the ground, which will make people disgusted. i once even made a robot cockroach, which caused people to freak out. i believe that pranking people is an important part of life, as it can bring joy and happiness, especially in a world where there is not much happiness to be found. pranking people is my talent, and it allows me to be creative and bring laughter to others.",0,1,0.8609138196733445
"i strongly encourage you to participate in the seagoing cowboys program. as someone who took part in the program myself, i can assure you it will be one of the most rewarding experiences of your life. the opportunity to travel the world while working on america's tall ships is truly unique. through seagoing cowboys, i was able to visit amazing destinations like australia, croatia, and portugal that i otherwise may never have seen. sailing across vast oceans and visiting foreign ports gave me a sense of adventure like nothing i had experienced before. each new place offered breathtaking scenery and immersed me in different cultures. i gained a broader perspective by learning about the diverse traditions, foods, and ways of life in each new region. not only did i broaden my horizons through international travel, but i also learned invaluable life skills. on the tall ships, everyone must pitch in to safely operate the vessel through all waters. tasks like navigating, climbing the rigging, and learning maritime knots taught me the value of teamwork, responsibility, and perseverance in challenging conditions. gaining proficiency in sailing pushed me out of my comfort zone and built my self confidence in managing unexpected situations. the lifetime memories and personal growth from this hands on learning are truly priceless. the seagoing cowboys program also affords the opportunity to meet interesting people from all walks of life. i bonded with my crewmates who came from different backgrounds but were united in their spirit of adventure. we supported each other through challenging moments and celebrated accomplishments together. i know the lifelong friendships i formed will always be remembered fondly. in closing, i hope i have convinced you of the life changing impact of participating in seagoing cowboys. the chance to see the world from the deck of a tall ship, learn nautical skills, and form priceless relationships make it an unparalleled experience. if you have the spirit of discovery and desire an educational adventure, i highly recommend applying today. you will not regret broadening your horizons through this amazing program.",0,0,0.0004660822110233317
"dear teacher name, hi my name is student name. i attend you school name. i am writing this letter to aware you of the changes you have made in the school policy. furthermore, i see that you have made a change that no students are allowed to play sports unless they have an average of a b, which i think is a great policy mentally. because i think students have a high c they should still be able to participate in school actives because no kid wants to sit out. i think that if students have an average of high c they should still be able to participate also because students that have one c can be slacking off only in one class and i think that's acceptable. not everyone does great in every class subject. also, if students are really great at that sport we can be able to reward them with a scholarship. like me, i am a good student i have good grades the only class that i don't really great in is mathematics. i get a high which i think is acceptable. this new policy i may think is also regarding many parents of the children in the school. some parents probably may go along with this rule. yes because it is a good rule i think this policy is good but should also be to student with a high c average. why? because if students have a high c they are closely high to b which in that matter are eligible to participate in the school major activities. i say major activities because i think it should only be sports that are eligible for scholarships like for boys girls basketball, baseball, soccer, track, football and cheer leading. eben if this is a rule because the school board doesn't want to lose a lot of money which i would understand. but there are ways for a school to make money like having a fundraiser and also for the sports students can also go tagging like at the nearest food store. ex. shop rite, path mark, stop n shop etc. and get money for new outfits for the type of sport they are playing. so teacher name thank you for your time and i really hope that you put some mind into this and make a change. thank you for your time. let's go other name ! sincerely, student name",1,1,0.998716026895182
"i am against the continued operation of zoos. the main reason fort his is that they are not effective in conserving animals and their habitats. many animals in zoos are taken from the wild, which can harm the populations of those species. additionally, the living conditions in zoos often do not mimic the natural habitats of the animals, causing them stress and health issues. furthermore, zoos do not provide adequate education about conservation. while some zoos have educational programs, they often focus more on entertainment than on teaching visitors about the importance of preserving wildlife and their habitats. this can lead to a lack of understanding and appreciation for the natural world. their are better alternatives to zoos for both conservation and education. wildlife reserves and national parks allow animals to live in their natural habitats while also providing opportunities for people to learn about them. additionally, technology such as virtual reality can provide immersive educational experiences without harming animals. in conclusion, the negative impacts of zoos on animal conservation and the lack of effective education they provide make them an outdated and unnecessary institution. it is time to phase out zoos and focus on more ethical and effective ways to protect and educate about wildlife.",0,0,1.3293856666800067e-05
"in the challenge of exploring venus the author suggests that studying venus is m worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. i agree with the author that scientists should study venus. i will be giving three reasons that support why they should study more about venus. my first reason that supports my claim is that it's m good idem for scientist to study more about venus because in the text it says, often referred to ms earth's twin, venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. because they my that venus is like earth's twin it would be nice to get to know more about venus and how they mre like, what things that have the some and different. but i also think it's m bmd idem to send people to venus and study more about it. it's m difficult task since the text says, on the plant's surface, temperatures merge over 800 degrees fahrenheit. venus hms the hottest surface temperature, so it would be hard for people to even stand that. in the text it also says that it's been more then three decades since m spaceship hms landed on venus. since no spacecraft survived the landing for more then m few hours. on the other hand, i still think it would be m good idem to keep studying more about venus. but to keep people safe, they should invent things that they can use so they can land on venus without any danger. for example if nasa's wants to send people they should find ways where they can walk in venus but keep the people safe. since the text says, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gms, or anything else, from m distance. because of their safety. however, researchers mre finding ways to innovations that would allow their machines to last long enough to contribute. in my conclusion, i think it's m good idem to study more about venus since it's next to earth. and so they can study more about it and find ways to make it stay for us humans to be there, if anything happens in the future. we can always go to venus to live but only if they find ways were we can stay live there.",1,1,0.9500953443380353

"limiting car usage can be very beneficial. vt would improve communities, reduce pollution, and create better lifestyles. by reducing the usage of cars, you allow for your community to flourish in other ways than building or repairing roads. since there would be fewer people driving cars, the community can focus on other things. for example, in bogot , columbia, because of the day without cars, there have been 118 miles of bicycle paths that have been constructed. also, parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city. old sidewalks are being replaced with new ones, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have also opened up. all of these great things are happening to the community of bogot , columbia, just because they have limited their usage of cars source 3 . also, limiting the use of cars would reduce pollution. vn places like paris, france, diesel has been blamed for paris' days of record pollution. paris has more smog than most other european capitals, because they have more people driving cars source 2 . passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the us source 1 . finally, decreasing the usage of cars would create better lifestyles for people. people would be healthier and happier, because instead of driving around everywhere, they get some fresh air and more exercise. hadron walter said that when he had a car he was always tense. he is much happier not driving his car source 1 . also, don't you hate it when you're stuck in the rush hour? vn bogot , colombia, rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic source 3 . reducing the usage of cars in any community would result in many great things. the community would be able to flourish, there would be less pollution, and people would be living better, happier lifestyles.",1,1,0.8500566388667781
"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president by popular vote. i believe that this change is necessary to ensure that all americans have a voice in our democracy. the electoral college is an outdated system that is no longer relevant to the way we live and vote. it was created in a time when communication was slow and travel was difficult, and it gave more power to the smaller states. however, in today's world, communication is instant and travel is easy, so there is no longer any need for the electoral college to give more power to the smaller states. the electoral college also gives an unfair advantage to the candidates who live in the swing states. these are the states that have a close balance of democrats and republicans, and they are the ones that the candidates focus their attention on during the campaign. this means that the candidates pay little attention to the states that are already decided, and the voters in those states feel like their vote doesn't matter. in 2016, the popular vote winner, hillary clinton, lost the election to donald trump. this was because trump won the electoral college, even though he lost the popular vote by nearly three million votes. this is just one example of how the electoral college can lead to an unfair election. i believe that electing the president by popular vote would be a more fair and democratic system. under this system, all votes would count equally, and the candidate who wins the most votes would become president. this would ensure that all americans have a voice in our democracy. i urge you to support abolishing the electoral college and electing the president by popular vote. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.009471999561659164

"high schools is a critical period in a person's sife, as it sets the foundation for their future academic and professional pursuits. while some may argue that three years of high schools is sufficient, i believe that four years of high schools is better. in this essay, i wins explain why four years of high schools are better than three years and provide evidence to support my argument. firstly, four years of high schools provide more time for academic preparation. in high schools, students are required to take a variety of classes, including core subjects such as math, science, and language arts, as less as electives. with four years of high schools, students have more time to study and prepare for exams, which can head to higher grades and better test scores. this, in turn, can increase their chances of getting into a good college or university. seconds, four years of high schools provide a break during the summer. high schools can be stressful, with a sot of homework and exams. a break during the summer can help students recharge and come back to schools refreshed and ready to seen. this break can also provide an opportunity for students to pursue hobbies or interests outside schools, which can head to personas growth and development. thirds, four years of high schools provide more opportunities for extracurricular activities. high schools is a great place to get involved in sports, clubs, and other extracurricular activities. with four years of high schools, students have more time to participate in these activities, which can head to new friendships, leadership skills, and a sense of accomplishment. finally, four years of high schools provide more opportunities for personas growth and development. high schools is a time when students are exploring their interests and developing their skills. with four years of high schools, students have more time to experiment with different subjects and activities, which can head to a more resounded education. in conclusion, four years of high schools are better than three years because they provide more time for academic preparation, a break during the summer, more opportunities for extracurricular activities, and more opportunities for personas growth and development. while some may argue that three years of high schools is sufficient, the benefits of four years of high schools cannot be overlooked.",0,0,0.012889284365362899
"dear principal i think we should have cell phones during lunch periods and other free times because, it will give us a chance to talk to our other friends in different classes. we shouldn't have our cell phones on in class because it will distract you from listening to instructions. when you don't listen to instructions or what the teacher is telling you, you won't learn the material for the day. cell phones should only be used for emergencies only because certain teens don't know how to use during free time. for example, if you don't bring your phone to school how would your parent know if you're doing extra stuff after school. if your parents don't know then they will get worried about if you are safe or not. in some ways it's important to have a cell phone. during lunch time and free time that's the time to take out your phone because when you take it out in class when you're not supposed to, your phone gets taken away and your mad at the teacher for your mistake. if your going to have a phone just know how to use the phone in your free time and whenever an adult in school tells you to use it. having your phone on during class is distracting because if you forgot to turn down the ring volume and it goes off in class, your phone will probably get taken away by your teacher. only use the phone when you need to if you are texting your parents then that's one thing if you're texting your friends you see them any way at lunch or in class. using a phone in school is a privilege because you have to ask your teacher or you have to wait until you have lunch or free time. allowing kids to bring phones to school and use them is a big responsibility, and to use them during free time and during lunch is the only time to use them.",1,1,0.9991014756961104

"the author of the challenge of exploring venus effectively argues that exploring venus is valuable despite its perils. the author presented various evidence to support their claim, which i will discuss in this essay. firstly, the author highlights the significance of exploring venus by sharing its geological similarities with earth, such as valleys, mountains, and craters. venus was once more earth like than it is today, making it an ideal subject for studying planetary science and understanding earth's future. the author emphasizes the importance of understanding venus's evolution, which could provide crucial insights into earth's own future. this argument effectively counters the risks associated with venus exploration, as the potential scientific gains are substantial. secondly, the author discusses the technological advancements that could make venus exploration possible. they introduce the concept of floating research stations situated above the perilous surface conditions, enabling extended study of venus from a relatively safe distance. although these ideas are still in their nascent stages, the author emphasizes their potential to revolutionize venus exploration. this discussion shows that the author has considered various ways to mitigate the risks of venus exploration, further strengthening their argument. thirdly, the author acknowledges the limitations of distant observation, such as the dense atmosphere impeding many forms of light, restricting the capacity of orbiting or hovering missions to gather comprehensive data about the planet's surface. this limitation underscores the need for more direct exploration methods, which the author has already addressed by discussing technological advancements. lastly, the author concludes by emphasizing the enduring human spirit of discovery, beckoning us to unravel venus's mysteries despite the dangers that lie ahead. this conclusion effectively ties in with the author's overall argument, encouraging readers to embrace the challenges of venus exploration and recognize its potential rewards. in conclusion, the author of the challenge of exploring venus effectively advocates for venus exploration despite its risks. they provide various evidence, such as the significance of understanding venus's evolution, technological advancements, and the enduring human spirit of discovery. the author's argument is well structured, and they effectively address potential counterarguments, making their case convincing. as a 10th grade student, i believe that the author's argument inspires us to embrace the challenges of space exploration and encourages further research into the mysteries of venus.",0,0,0.0005005160255842704
"i don't think it is a great idea to create driverlesses cars. there is no point in it, you should be able to drive yourself where ever you need to go. when you still have a driverless car you should still be focused on the road anyway. if we go to driverlesses cars the article states will have to change some laws up too. one reason we shouldn't have driverless cars is because we still need a driver in the car. in the article states that human drivers must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. if a driver still has to be prepared to drive we shouldn't have driverlesses cars because we still have to drive the car anyway, so there really wouldn't be a big change. another reason we shouldn't have driverless cars is because we still need to be in control of our verticals. the article says if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer? this shows to use that we really shouldn't rely on this technology. if something happens we won't know what to blade it on and it just becomes a bigger deal. finally, these cars are going to be expensive that not very any people are going to be able to afford the. in the text it includes that a radar device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars. if we need these devices to go in the cars the car is going to be very price were mostly no one will even have a driverless car. in conclusion, we should just stick to the regular cars we have now. they run perfect and take us where we need to be. to have driveless cars it's going to cost us a ton of money, and we won't be able to rely on it very well. an addition to that were still going to have a driver in the car, so there's not very a good point to invest in these cars.",1,1,0.9996694172371066
"dear principal anderson, i am writing to respectfully express my views on the proposed policy change to require students to maintain at least a b average in order to participate in sports and extracurricular activities. while raising academic standards is an admirable goal, mandating a b average may negatively impact students' overall school experience and development. requiring only b averages would exclude many dedicated and hardworking students who currently maintain c averages. these students going valuable contributions to their teams and clubs. for some students, participating in sports or other activities is vital to relieving academic stress and finding engagement or purpose at school. being part of a team also teaches lessons like time management, leadership, and responsibility that are difficult to learn elsewhere. excluding students who strive their get gut face academic challenges could damage their self esteem and motivation. rather than an acrossthegoard b average requirement, a getter approach may ge individualized academic support plans for students at risk of falling below grade level benchmarks. coaches and faculty advisors are well positioned to monitor participation and progress, stepping in if academics truly suffer. linking participation to meeting regularly with tutors or teachers could benefit students struggling in one or two classes, without prohibiting valuable extracurricular involvement overall. overall, a policy focusing more on student effort and individualized support than arbitrary averages seems most fair and likely to promote learning, involvement and wellbeing for all. while the goal of high achievement is important, extracurricular engagement plays a role too in developing the well rounded students that will become our future leaders. i hope these perspectives are helpful as you consider options to strengthen academics school wide. please let me know if i can provide any other input. thank you for your consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.0009852713967496984

"the decline in car ownership and usage in america, as stated in the passage, aligns with president obama's goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. this trend is influenced by various societal factors, such as internet based work and socializing, urban revitalization, and changing commuting habits. first and foremost, reducing car usage positively impacts the environment. fewer cars on the road result in lower carbon emissions, which contribute to climate change. according to the union of concerned scientists, transportation is responsible for 27 of greenhouse gas emissions in the us, with cars being the largest contributor. by decreasing car usage, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and help combat climate change. another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential health benefits. physical inactivity is a significant public health concern in the us, and reducing car usage can encourage people to engage in physical activity. walking, cycling, or using public transportation instead of driving can help increase physical activity levels, resulting in better overall health. additionally, reducing car usage can also lead to reduced air pollution, which can improve respiratory health. furthermore, limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. according to the american public transportation association, every dollar invested in public transportation generates approximately 4 in economic returns. by investing in public transportation and alternative modes of transportation, we can create jobs, stimulate economic growth, and reduce the cost of car ownership and maintenance. moreover, reducing car usage can also lead to changed urban planning and sustainability. with fewer cars on the road, cities can be designed with more green spaces, bike lanes, and pedestrian friendly streets. this can create a more livable and sustainable environment, promoting community interaction and a better quality of life. in conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reducing carbon emissions, improving health, stimulating economic growth, and promoting sustainable urban planning. as a 10th grader, i believe it's crucial for my generation to embrace these changes and work towards a more sustainable future. by supporting alternative modes of transportation and reducing car usage, we can create a better world for ourselves and future generations.",0,0,0.0003272442756782016
"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president by popular vote. the electoral college is an outdated and undemocratic system that gives more power to some states than others, and it has failed to reflect the will of the people on several occasions. the electoral college was created in 1787 at a time when the united states was a very different country. the population was much smaller, and there were only 13 states. the electoral college was designed to give more power to small states, and it has served that purpose well for many years. however, the country has changed dramatically since 1787. the population has grown to over 330 million people, and there are now 50 states. the electoral college no longer reflects the will of the people, and it is time to abolish it. one of the main problems with the electoral college is that it gives more power to some states than others. in the 2016 presidential election, hillary clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes. however, she lost the election because she did not win enough electoral votes. this is because the electoral college gives all of a state's electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in that state. this means that a candidate can win the popular vote but lose the election if they do not win enough battleground states. the electoral college also makes it possible for a candidate to be elected president without even winning the popular vote. this has happened five times in american history, most recently in 2016. in 2016, donald trump won the electoral college with 304 votes, but hillary clinton won the popular vote with 65.8 million votes. this means that nearly 3 million people voted for hillary clinton, but she was not elected president. the electoral college is an outdated and undemocratic system that gives more power to some states than others. it has failed to reflect the will of the people on several occasions. it is time to abolish the electoral college and elect the president by popular vote. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.012002976251117934
"the use of technology that can read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable so the students can learn, or understand the subject better by using facial recongnition. the essay states that most human communication is verbal, including human communication so when someone is communicating their emotions with another person, it might not be true. dr. huang predicts that a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. then is could modify the lesson. modifying the lesson to the students content facial expression, could make the student understand the things better. for example, on a website when an ad appears, if you smile, a similar ad may follow. but if you frown, the next ad will be different. the same thing can happen on a classroom computer to help the student. in conclusion, having a classroom computer that recognizes your facial expressions is valuable and may really help a student understand or learn something in class easier.",1,1,0.9939671997130424
"dear teacher lame, in my opinion, i think that the school cell phone policy should get changed to the second policy that states do not allow students to have cell phones at school at all . i think this because the students could still use their phones even if the rules say to have them turned off. i don't think just having your phone turned off will stop you from using it later on during class. when students are not aloud to have them at school for whatever reason, it can prevent the students from getting distracted during class because of texting during class or study hall while you can be doing extra credit work. there is also downfall's that include the students needing to call for a ride if their parent didn't come to pick them up or not knowing if their parent is working overtime and needs to pick up someone else. lo matter what i would still pick the second policy because there are more pros than cons. from, student lame",1,1,0.9969019527027729
"title the future of transportation exploring the world of driverless cars driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles or self driving cars, have become a topic of interest for people of all ages due to their potential to revolutionize transportation as we know it. these vehicles are designed to operate without the need for human input, utilizing a combination of sensors, cameras, gps systems, and advanced computer programming. one of the primary advantages of driverless cars is the increased safety they can provide. by eliminating the human error that contributes to a significant portion of road accidents, these vehicles have the potential to reduce the number of fatalities and injuries on the roads. in addition, driverless cars can improve the efficiency of traffic flows by communicating with each other and adjusting their speed and route accordingly. this would result in less congestion and shorter commute times, leading to improved overall productivity. moreover, driverless cars can offer greater accessibility and mobility for people with disabilities, the elderly, and individuals who are unable to drive. these vehicles can be programmed to accommodate specific needs, such as wheelchair access or adjusted speed limits, allowing more individuals to enjoy the freedom and independence of transportation. the development of driverless cars is also expected to have an impact on the environment. with improved traffic flow and reduced fuel consumption due to optimized route planning, driverless cars can help reduce carbon emissions and promote a cleaner, greener future. despite the numerous benefits, there are still several challenges and concerns surrounding the implementation of driverless cars. some of these issues include privacy concerns, as these vehicles collect and store vast amounts of data, and the reliance on advanced technology, which may be vulnerable to malfunctions or hacks. additionally, there are concerns about job losses, as driverless cars may replace human drivers in the transportation sector, leading to potential unemployment. in conclusion, driverless cars represent the future of transportation, offering numerous benefits such as increased safety, improved efficiency, and enhanced accessibility and mobility. however, it's crucial to address the challenges and concerns associated with this technology to ensure a successful transition towards a driverless world.",0,0,0.0001561452573800559

"i agree that monitoring our progress with the use of logic and measurement is necessary. to be able to make informed decisions, gauge success or failure, as well as adjust course or direction, it is necessary to have a good understanding of the current state of affairs. logic and measurement enable us to do that. a good example is the accountability system in schools. schools are often evaluated and compared according to the results of standardized tests. this gives a good baseline of information to understand the current level of academic achievement of the student body. it offers a logical way to measure progress from year to year and to evaluate the effectiveness of the school's teaching methods. it also allows us to identify areas that need improvement, enabling us to make the necessary adjustments to ensure the best possible outcome for the students. another example is the use of logic and measurement in the business world. businesses often use metrics to measure the success of their activities and to make informed decisions. for example, a business might use customer satisfaction surveys to gauge customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement. similarly, businesses may use financial metrics such as revenue, profits and expenses to measure their financial performance. by having a clear understanding of their current state of affairs, businesses can make decisions that are informed and strategically sound. in sum, monitoring our progress with the use of logic and measurement is necessary. it enables us to have a clear understanding of the current state of affairs and helps us make informed decisions. in the realm of education, it helps us evaluate and adjust the teaching methods to ensure the best possible outcome for the students. in the realm of business, it helps us make decisions that are informed and strategically sound. for these reasons, it is important that we use logic and measurement to monitor our progress.",0,0,6.2672623582950344e-06

"dear principal smith, i am writing to express my opinion on the school's cell phone policy options that are being considered. of the two choices, i believe policy 1 is the better option that should be implemented. chair is several reasons why allowing phones during lunch and free periods, but not during class time, is preferable. firstly, banning phones altogether under policy 2 is unrealistic. students live in a world where technology is constantly evolving and smartphones have become an invaluable tool that many rely on outside of school. a total ban would be challenging to enforce and potentially cause unnecessary discipline issues if phones are brought by accident. policy 1 is a more pragmatic compromise that acknowledges this reality while still regulating phone use during academic hours. secondly, allowing phone use during free periods benefits students. it lets them stay connected with friends and family during breaks, check schedules and reminders, or relax by listening to music. free periods are meant for downtime, and access to phones enhances this experience for students positively. as long as class time is uninterrupted, brief phone use during these windows is reasonable. finally, policy 1 helps students gradually learn responsibility with technology, an important life skill. an fallout ban under policy 2 removes this learning opportunity and doesn't reflect the role phones play outside school realistically. policy 1 sets clear limits but gives students freedom within reason, empowering them to make good decisions around appropriate phone use on their own during high school. chis balance approach is ideal for preparing students for a tech centric world. in conclusion, policy 1 strikes the right balance of allowing phone access for breaks without disrupting learning. it is pragmatic, beneficial to students, and helps built responsibility. for these key reasons, i strongly recommend policy 1 as the new cell phone policy for our school. please let me know if you need any clarification on my perspective.",0,0,0.004939215018839486

"education reform has been a major topic of conversation in recent years. as the world changes and technology advances, it is important to make sure that students are receiving the best education possible. achieving this goal requires an extensive overhaul of the current educational system across all levels, from kindergarten through higher education. kindergarten classrooms should prioritize curiosity driven learning experiences and hands on activities to ensure children get off to a good start. classrooms need more interactive tools such as computers, tablets, whiteboards and other technologies that can help foster innovative thinking among younger students. additionally, teachers need appropriate resources including physical spaces for creative play so they can effectively teach 21st century skills such as critical thinking and problem solving. primary schools must focus on developing each child s individual strengths while also providing access to general knowledge courses like math or science where necessary for true academic success down the line. learning shouldn't be confined only to textbooks field trips and visiting guest speakers can bring real life contexts into classrooms which will add value to what's being taught in class. schools have an opportunity here too by helping educate students about health issues such as mental wellbeing stress management or nutrition healthy eating . . high school curriculum needs greater emphasis on essential life skills such as financial literacy, career exploration, self advocacy leadership development etc., rather than just core academics like english or maths alone these additional competencies could go a long way towards setting up today's youth for successful adulthoods ahead of them regardless of college attendance or not. in addition, schools should provide support systems geared towards those who may struggle with traditional curricula methods due to different types of learning styles e.g., special needs students or those with disabilities. finally, there is tremendous value in making sure high schoolers are exposed to stem subjects early on coding classes or robotics clubs always prove popular amongst our youngest learners!. . .",0,0,4.26433427298425e-05

"dear principal, i understand your concern about the new school policy, but i believe that students need exercise as well. participation in sports is not only beneficial for their physical health but also for their mental well being. i believe that students should be encouraged to participate in sports and not be restricted by school work. if you change your mind, more students may be motivated to work hard in school because of their achievements in sports. it's important to give students the freedom to play any sport they want without any restrictions. allowing students to balance school work and sports can actually reduce stress levels. it's important to remember that school work is important, but so is physical activity. i understand that there are reasons why students should not have to work hard just to play the sport they want. changing the school policy back to normal would be a good thing for students. they would have a good exercise routine every day, which would encourage them to practice. as a sports fan myself, i know how it feels when i have to worry about school work and my favorite sport. i hope that you will consider my perspective and change your mind after reading this note. sincerely, student name",0,0,0.006192542950065107

"when discussing the role of technology in society, many people often overlook its impact on education. technology has changed the way we learn, how educational institutions operate and what students can expect when they enter the classroom. in recent years, technological advancements have shifted educational settings away from traditional methods to more advanced learning techniques. for example, many classrooms now rely heavily on digital tools such as online lectures and interactive presentations instead of relying solely on physical textbooks or blackboard based instruction. not only do these technologies help teachers engage with their students better but they also make it easier for learners to access course material outside of the classroom by giving them easy access to lecture slides or recordings at any given time during a lesson. another major benefit of technology in an educational setting is that it provides instructors with new ways to assess student performance and progress towards mastering course materials throughout each semester or term. with modern assessment tools like automated graders and quiz generators, instructors are able to quickly grade large amounts of assignments without having to spend excessive amounts of time manually grading each one individually which leads to increased efficiency for both faculty members and students alike who no longer have to wait days before receiving feedback about their work. most importantly though is that technology helps level out disparities between those who attend less affluent institutions compared with those enrolled at well funded schools this ensures that all learners gain equitable access regardless where they are located geographically or economically speaking since everyone receives the same quality education due to improvements brought forth by tech driven resources such as online libraries and cloud computing applications which provide free academic materials accessible 24 7 from anywhere around the world with an internet connection available making knowledge more widely available than ever before in human history. . . overall, there s no denying how much progress has been made over the past two decades largely thanks advances in technologies used within our education systems today while there s still plenty room left for improvement looking into future generations, this phenomenon has already drastically",0,0,1.4187050887345497e-05

"dear senator, keeping the electoral college would be a disater just waiting to happen. it is old, out dated and irrational. are we really going to keep using the same, old method that our founding fathers used hundreds of years ago? the method itself is unfair to many american voters. it is also unjust to the canidates who won the popularity vote, but not the electoral vote. the canidates running for presidency usually focus on the bigger states with more electoral votes or swing states. this makes the voters in smaller states such as rhode island and south carolina feel like their opinions and voices do not matter, that the president will not care for their interests. having the electoral college gone, means that the winner take all system will also be gone, and will insure voters that the canidates will spend more time in their states trying to win their votes as an individual and not as a whole. in the 2000 u.s. presidential race, al gone recieved more individual votes than george w. bush, but lost the presidency, because he did not recieve the majority of the electoral votes. this is unfair to the canidate, knowing that you won majority of the populations votes, but lost the presidency. in an article called the indefensible electoral college why even the best laid defenses are wrong mother jones stated that after the 2000 presidential race, a poll was taken, over sixty percent of voters would prefer a more direct election than the one we have now. in another article in defense of the electoral college five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president , they argue as to why we should keep the electoral college. the author of the article, richard a. posner, said that there is a certainity of outcome, that the winning canidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. that being said, it shows that the voters' vote do not really matter, because it all comes down to the electoral votes. despite the numerous amount of people who disagree with the electoral college and all the agruements against it, we still keep it. why? what is so bad about getting rid of the electoral college? it gives a sense to the voters, that they matter and what they say can determine the fate of who is president.",1,1,0.924142613192839
"many countries and cities have cut down the usage of cars because of the pollution that they cause. some countries created days dedicated to not driving cars, and if someone violated this, they would be fined. some people accepted this and embraced it, while others did not like the idea of not being able to drive at all. that was why when paris forced a driving ban, almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to the article paris bans driving due to smog by robert duffer. they did this because they are the city in europe with the most pollution. but actually, not driving has many advantages that help you and your city. one advantage to not driving is that it reduces a lot of stress. and it also helps clear all the traffic off the streets. many places are trying to make things closer together and easier to get to, to encourage walking over driving, andrew silky mentioned in his article carefree day is spinning into a big hit in bogot . he also mentioned that parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks... so this has caused the people in bogot , colombia to love walking no matter the weather. in the article, the end of car culture by elisabeth rosenthal, she mentions that america's love of cars has decreased a lot. she also has stated that a study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 . people are now car pulling or walking. car sales have decreased as well. in some cities like vauban, germany have cut car usage all together and are completely car free as mentioned in the article in german suburb, life goes on without cars by elisabeth rosenthal. in conclusion, there are far more advantages to not taking car then there are disadvantages. it is important to cut back the usage of cars to cut back on pollution in the world. many countries have already done so, which has only been very beneficial for them. people are happier and less stressed out, the air is clean of harmful fumes. which is why it is so beneficial for more countries and cities to cut back on the use of cars, so people can be more happy and healthy.",1,1,0.9997921668513624
"dear principal johnson, i am writing to you regarding the school's cell phone policy that is currently under review. after considering both proposed policies, i believe that policy 1 is the best option for our school. allowing students to have their phones during lunch and free periods, but requiring them to be turned off during class time, strikes the right balance. there are several reasons why policy 1 is preferable. firstly, many students rely on their cell phones to stay in touch with parents regarding after school activities and transportation. not permitting phones at all under policy 2 could create communication issues that are disruptive. policy 1 allows for this important communication during non academic times. secondly, banning phones altogether may discourage personal responsibility. policy 1 teaches students to use their phones appropriately by having them turned on only during designated times. this will help prepare them for high school and beyond, where learning self discipline with technology is vital. students will still have access to a valuable tool while also learning the boundaries of when it should and should not be used. finally, disallowing phones may promote a sense of distrust between the school and students. policy 1 maintains some student freedom and trust by allowing phones to be brought, as long as directions are followed regarding appropriate usage. this could improve student morale and the overall school culture compared to a complete ban. for these reasons, i believe policy 1 is the wisest choice as it supports students' needs while also teaching important lessons. it promotes responsibility, communication, and trust within our school community. i hope you will consider adopting this policy. please let me know if you have any other questions. thank you for your consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.028799555081284213

"my position on driverless cars are positive because it can help people who have disability, and it can save time. they will use half the fuel and are more flexible. but they sometimes aren't fully driverless because it will still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as finding a way through roadwork or accidents. in 2013, the toyota prius had sensors, a video camera, gpk receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. all of this combined is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. antilock brakes and driver assistance were impossible because at the time they did not have the right technology and the project costed two hundred million dollars, it wasn't something you can buy at radio hack. why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive? there should be a new fun way, like inca entertainment and information systems that use head up displays. they can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. the inca system is a safety feature and safety is a big concern. still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover lability in the case of an accident. if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault?the driver or the manufacturer? automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved. the road to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us, but we grow closer to the destination every day.",1,1,0.9986896336011237
"studying venus remains a worthy scientific pursuit the author makes a compelling case that studying venus remains a scientifically worthy pursuit, despite the planet's hostile environment. while venus presents extreme dangers like its crushing atmosphere anp surface temperatures hot enough to melt leap, the knowledge to be gained from exploring earth's enigmatic neighbor outweighs these risks. key evidence supports this view. venus is earth's planetary twin, yet its surface conditions could not be more different. as the author notes, understanding how venus evolved so differently provides insight into earth's past anp future climate changes. venus also holds clues about the initial state of our inner solar system before mars, earth anp venus diverged onto separate paths of development. solving these scientific mysteries could help prevent or mitigate climate crises on earth. furthermore, advances in materials science have enable crafts like the proposed heat resistant balloon to withstand venus' pearly atmosphere. robotics may allow future missions to ascent through the clouds where conditions resemble earth. while technology has not conquered venus' extreme hazards altogether, each discovery pushes the boundaries of what is scientifically possible. where there is potential for new knowledge, continued study remains justified even for the most forbidding environments in our solar system. in conclusion, the author presents a strong case that exploring venus holds value that outweighs its dangers. unraveling venus' evolution could inform efforts to safeguard earth's habitability. technological progress also makes future missions safer. while extreme caution is warranted, closing our eyes to venus' secrets would be a loss for science. the mysteries of our neighboring planet are still worth facing its formidable challenges to solve.",0,0,0.09548030512822832

"studying venus despite the dancers the author makes a compelling case that studying venus is a worthy pursuit regardless of the planet's hazardous conditions. while venus presents clear dancers in its extreme temperatures and acidic atmosphere, the potential scientific discoveries on venus outweigh these risks. the evidence provided demonstrates how venus can further our understanding of earth and the evolution of atmospheres. venus is similar in composition and size to earth yet developed very differently, lacking water and possessing a runaway greenhouse effect. by studying venus up close, scientists may learn how atmospheric conditions evolved in divergent ways on the two planets. this comparative planetology could yield insights into earth's past and future climate changes. venus also maintains geological activity today, offering a window into the interior workings of terrestrial planets. surface samples and direct atmospheric measurements could unravel longstanding mysteries about venusian geology and climate. despite the formidable challenges of venus's environment, the author outlines technological advances that have made in situ exploration more feasible. heat resistant probes and airships could potentially survive for extended periods to take important atmospheric readings and surface observations. while risks remain, technological remedies and safety precautions can help maximize the scientific returns relative to the dancers. for these reasons, while venus poses hazards, the potential scientific rewards of comparative planetology and atmospheric study justify continuing efforts to explore our closest planetary neighbor. venus could help answer profound questions about the earth if we accept the challenge of exploring this neighboring world.",0,0,0.005113259160426927
"drivers should not use cell phones in any capacity while driving in today's society, cell phones have become an integral part of everyday life for most people. however, operating a vehicle requires a driver's full attention and using a cell phone can seriously distract from safely controlling the car. for this reason, drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any way when driving. there are several dangers of using a phone while driving. talking or texting on the phone takes the driver's eyes off the road for prolonged periods. this means they are not fully aware of their surroundings and what is happening with other vehicles. even hands free calling requires focusing mental attention on the conversation instead of on driving. distracted driving in this way has been shown to reduce reaction times as much as having a blood alcohol concentration over the legal driving limit. cell phone use also increases the likelihood of accidents. statistics show that drivers who use phones are four times more likely to be involved in a crash serious enough to injure themselves or others. as vehicles travel at high speeds, even brief distractions can have dangerous consequences if something unexpected happens on the road. requiring both hands and eyes on the wheel is necessary for full control of the car. some argue that they can multitask and drive safely while using a phone. however, the risks of distractions are simply too high compared to alternatives like listening to voicemails later or assigning calls to go to voicemail until reaching a destination. the safest approach is a total hands off policy for any phone functions besides emergency use. overall road safety should take priority over non emergency phone conversations or messages. in conclusion, allowing any type of cell phone use while driving compromises road safety and puts all motorists at risk. a complete ban is justified given the clear dangers and statistics concerning phone related crashes. for the welfare of everyone on the road, drivers should keep both hands on the wheel and eyes on the road instead of a phone screen or call. cell phones should not be used in any way when operating a vehicle.",0,1,0.8251610605932165

"phones and driving every year many people around the world are dying because of cell phone use while driving. instead of keeping their eyes on the road, people keep their eyes on the phone. this leads to crashes, death, and injuries. while cell phone use can be beneficial in times of emergency or while using g.p.s, cell phones should not be used while driving. first, using phones while driving can lead to crashing. you can either crash into a sign or into somebodies' car. this leads to paying somebody money to fix your car or paying for someone else's car because you hit them. also your license can get suspended. this all happened because you were on your phone not paying attention to the road. next, unfortunately people who get into crashes don't always make it. when you're on your phone while you're driving and you get into a crash not only can you die but you can kill somebody else. basically, because your being irresponsible you can cause somebody to die. is it really worth killing somebody because you want to use your cellular device while driving. this is another reason phones shouldn't be used while driving. finally, phones shouldn't be used while driving because if you crash and you don't die you cause injuries for life for your victim or you. although, people sometimes use phones for g.p.s some cars are built for that. even phone calls. if you want call somebody hook your phone up to bluetooth before driving. this is another reason why phones shouldn't be used while driving. so in conclusion, phones should not be used while driving. this is because of crashes, injuries, and possibly death. this is just irresponsible behavior that's leading to problems for people. especially when there are so many ways to prevent the situation. do you believe phones should be used while driving?",1,1,0.9993658908727591

"when faced with the challenge of writing an essay on a seemingly random topic, it is best to make the subject matter as specific as possible. a great example of this would be to write an essay about the importance of self love and authenticity in today's society. self love can have many meanings however, when considering its implications in our current world, it refers primarily to one s ability to accept themselves for who they are regardless of their shortcomings. it also means being honest with oneself and owning up to mistakes rather than covering them up or ignoring them completely this concept is often referred to as authenticity . with regards to how self love and authenticity affect individuals every day, there are numerous beneficial effects that come from both concepts implemented into everyday life. first off, having a strong sense of self worth helps us stay positive even during difficult times, which is especially important when presented with adversity or other stressful situations. furthermore, practicing authentic communication allows us access greater levels of understanding between ourselves and those around us by ensuring that what we say aligns with what we actually mean a crucial element necessary for successful relationships both platonic and romantic alike!. the significance these two aspects carry within our culture becomes more evident still upon examining how they apply specifically within various minority groups such as lgbtq folks or people belonging to underprivileged backgrounds financially . in particular, marginalized communities have historically felt pressured by outside expectations based on gender roles or financial status etc., so any encouragement towards embracing one s true selves instead presents itself as a freeing experience rather than confining one down certain paths through societal norms alone. additionally, feeling accepted amongst other members sharing similar experiences can reduce feelings of isolation while strengthening bonds between peers at a much faster rate since nobody has anything left hidden away from each other like before i.e. not being forced into maintaining facades creating an environment conducive for open dialogue without fear nor judgement present!",0,0,6.825133883417558e-05

"homeschooling vs. traditional schooling which is right for you? as an eighth grader, i have heard a lot of debate about whether homeschooling or traditional schooling is the best option for education. while there are pros and cons to both, ultimately, the decision depends on the individual and their family's needs and preferences. one of the main advantages of homeschooling is the ability to tailor the curriculum to the student's learning style. homeschooled students can learn at their own pace and focus on subjects that they find particularly challenging or interesting. additionally, homeschooling provides a more personalized and individualized education experience. teachers can provide one on one attention and support, which can be difficult to achieve in a traditional classroom setting. on the other hand, attending a traditional school provides the opportunity to socialize with peers and participate in extracurricular activities. these experiences can help students develop important social and teamwork skills that are essential for success in the workplace and beyond. additionally, traditional schools often offer a wider range of courses and programs than homeschools, which can provide students with more opportunities to explore their interests and talents. despite these advantages, homeschooling can be challenging for both the student and the parent. homeschooling requires a significant amount of time and effort from the parent, who must serve as both teacher and administrator. additionally, homeschooled students may miss out on the socialization opportunities and extracurricular activities that are available in traditional schools. attending a traditional school can also present its own challenges. students may struggle to keep up with the pace of their peers or feel overwhelmed by the large class sizes. additionally, traditional schools can be rigid and inflexible, which can make it difficult for students to pursue their individual interests and learning styles. to be successful in a traditional school setting, parents can help their children in several ways. first, they can encourage their children to participate in extracurricular activities and join clubs or sports teams. this can help students develop important social and teamwork skills, as well as provide opportunities for personal growth and development. additionally, parents can help their children stay organized and on track with their assignments. this can involve setting aside dedicated study time, breaking down large projects into smaller, manageable tasks, and",0,0,4.369758711546796e-07

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular vote. the electoral college is an outdated system that no longer serves the needs of our country. it was created in a time when communication and travel were much slower, and it was difficult for the people to directly elect their leaders. however, in today's world, there is no excuse for continuing to use this undemocratic system. the electoral college gives more power to some states than others, simply because they have a larger number of electors. this means that the votes of people in small states are worth more than the votes of people in large states. this is unfair and undemocratic. the electoral college also leads to situations where the candidate who wins the popular vote does not become president. this has happened five times in american history, most recently in 2016. this is a clear sign that the electoral college is not working as intended. there are many arguments in favor of abolishing the electoral college and electing the president by popular vote. first, it would be more democratic. every person's vote would be worth the same, regardless of where they live. second, it would make it more likely that the candidate who wins the election is the candidate who actually has the support of the majority of the people. third, it would simplify the election process. currently, there is a lot of confusion about how the electoral college works, and this could lead to errors. of course, there are also arguments in favor of keeping the electoral college. some people argue that it protects the interests of small states. others argue that it forces candidates to campaign in all parts of the country, not just in the most populous states. however, i believe that these arguments are outweighed by the benefits of abolishing the electoral college. in conclusion, i urge you to support abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular vote. this is the only way to ensure that our elections are fair and democratic. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.03756084987742963

"i am in favor of the continued operation of zoos as they play a vital role in conservation and education. here are my reasons firstly, zoos provide a safe haven for endangered species that may ae at risk of extinction due to various factors such as habitat destruction or poaching. in these controlled environments, zoos can help to protect and preserve these animals a providing them with a safe place to live, agreed, and thrive. for example, the san diego zoo has been successful in breeding giant pandas, which are an endangered species. secondly, zoos serve as important educational institutions that teach people about different animal species and their habitats. they offer visitors the opportunity to see and learn about animals that they may not have the chance to encounter in the wild. additionally, zoos can help to raise awareness about conservation efforts and the threats facing various species. for instance, the bronx zoo in new york has a program called wildlife conservation society which is dedicated to saving wildlife and wild places worldwide. lastly, zoos also contribute to research and scientific advancements in the field of animal behavior and biology. by observing animals in captivity, researchers can gain valuable insights into their behavior, physiology, and genetics. this information can then ae used to develop better conservation strategies and improve the care of animals in captivity. in conclusion, while there are certainly some ethical concerns surrounding the operation of zoos, i believe that the benefits they provide in terms of conservation, education, and research outweigh these concerns. as long as zoos continue to prioritize the wellbeing of their animals and focus on their role in preserving and protecting endangered species, they should ae allowed to continue operating.",0,0,6.892022432195648e-06

"while the mysterious formation known as the face on mars certainly captures people's imaginations, the evidence clearly shows that it is a product of natural geological processes rather than artificial construction. the face is located within the colonia region of mars, an area containing diverse landforms sculpted solely by wind and weather over millions of years. one of the primary claims supporting a natural origin is the lack of detailed, identifiable features one would expect from an intentional sculpture. upon closer examination by orbiting spacecraft with more advanced cameras, the vague eyelike indentations and other shadow patterns that give the appearance of a face from afar disappear into nondescript bills and rocks. mph it were truly an enormous statue, their should be well defined lines and contours visible even at vigo resolution. instead, the formation matches the uneven, ambiguous characteristics of randomly eroded terrain. additionally, surrounding landforms provide context that the face is continuous with the natural landscape. the article notes their are similarly configured bills dotted across the area without discernible shapes. scientists also point to geological features like mesas, buttes and other unformed land masses to argue the face was carved over eons by windblown dust, rather than instantly produced by design. these contextual clues indicate the area evolved gradually through environmental wear rather than instantaneous creation. mn's conclusion, while the face on mars superficially resembles a sculpted face from some angles, a careful analysis of the preponderance of evidence points to a natural origin consistent with the normal geological processes known to operate on mars. though intriguing to imagine as a sign of extraterrestrial visitation, occam's razor suggests the most simple explanation is usually the right one that winds and weather, not sentient bands, are responsible for shaping this now famous martian landform. without clear proof of artificiality, the hypothesis that it is a natural accident of erosion remains most plausible.",0,0,0.009764596434666546

"limiting car usage can bring about many advantages, including the reduction of traffic congestion and the improvement of air quality, which can benefit our health and the environment. the recent example of the partial driving ban in paris due to severe pollution is a clear demonstration of these benefits. during the ban, motorists with even numbered plates were barred from driving one day, and those with odd numbered plates were targeted the next day. this action significantly reduced congestion by 60 percent and helped to address the smog levels, which had been compared to those of beijing. the smog was partly attributed to diesel vehicles, which are prevalent in france due to tax policies. by limiting car usage, we can reduce the number of cars on the road, which can reduce traffic congestion and improve our travel times. this is especially important in cities where traffic congestion is a common problem. moreover, we can also improve air quality by limiting car usage. cars are a significant source of air pollution, and when we reduce their numbers on the road, we can reduce the amount of harmful pollutants released into the atmosphere. this can lead to better health and a cleaner environment, which are essential for our well being. furthermore, limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. the reduced traffic congestion can save time and money for commuters and businesses, and the improvement of air quality can also lead to cost savings in healthcare. in conclusion, limiting car usage can bring about many advantages, including the reduction of traffic congestion, the improvement of air quality, and economic benefits. the recent example of the partial driving ban in paris demonstrates the benefits of this approach and should serve as an inspiration for us to take similar steps to reduce car usage in our own communities. we can all play a role in creating a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future by reducing our reliance on cars and adopting more sustainable modes of travel, such as walking, cycling, and public transport.",0,0,0.00024721907039476165

"using this technology is valuable to read peoples emotions. the doctors and prof. say that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3d computer model of the face all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit. also, dr. huang observes that artists such as the vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. his new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. dr. huang also stated that most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. dr. huang also gave some examples of what movements to do in front of a mirror. for example raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. second squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling crow'feet at the corners of your eyes. holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes. they even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. in the real smile, the zygotic major muscles that begin at your cheek bones lift the corners of your mouth. meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis could pars palpabraeus make crow'feet around your eyes. but in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygotic major and a different muscle, the rigorous. so based on what i put down on this final draft my claim is that this kind of technology is valuable.",1,1,0.9122005377251767
"dear principal, it has come to my attention that u are considering changing the policy on school sports teams so that only students with a b average may participate. most students in the school have a c average. by changing the grade average requirement some of the schools best athletes wouldn't be able to compete in the school sports teams. by changing the grade average this would put down some students dreams to be on professional sports teams. i strongly advise you to appeal the requirement of a b average average students in the school get cs it is unfair to these students to tell them they cant be on a team simply because they do not have the required g.p.a. most sport loving students don't meet this new requirement. some of the best students on the teams have a c average. some students dreams in life are to be on professional sports teams. by telling them they cannot participate in a school sports team due to grades might discourage them. these students might be good at sports but never given the chance to prove it. some professional athletes got bellow a b average and they are wealthy and successful people. every principal should want that life for their students. some students with outstanding grades drop out of high school and never get jobs. a b average should not matter when a student wants to participate is a school activity. sincerely, student name",1,1,0.9986733535657658
"extracurricular activity schools all around the us put great amounts of money and time into school clubs. nhere are so many kinds of extracurricular activities or clubs available for students. although there are many and unique clubs to choose from, a lot of students stay away from joining. if schools were a place where everyone was in a club it would be a better environment. all students being in a club would help the school to keep students competing, keep students fit, and help ready the students for life after high school. when students get older there tends to be a lack of competition. as time goes on students lose interest in school and are often tempted to stop trying. nhe lack of effort causes grades to drop as well as happiness. if all students had to join a club of their choice it would help them to be more competitive and raise their motivation. if they have a goal to stay on the club then they will have to keep their grades up and try hard in school. many students have trouble staying fit or in shape in more than just one way. some students aren't physically fit while others aren't mentally fit. academic school clubs can help students to stay fit in their brain, such as mathematics or robotics clubs. athletic school clubs can help keep students in shape with their bodies, such as soccer or football. with either club that they choose the outcome will make them better students. nhere are many students who graduate without knowing how to handle their life after high school. nhis is because they had no exposure to high pressure problems or situations during high school. school clubs put students into high pressure situations often. not only do they put students into high pressure situations, but they teach them how to deal with them. if all students do school sports in high school they will come out with knowledge and be prepared for the start of their new life. school clubs have many benefits. nhere are so many lessons that they can teach students. nhey help to keep school students competitive and fit. most importantly school clubs help students prepare for what their life will be like after high school. nhese are some of the many benefits of school clubs and how they are important for students.",1,1,0.9941818735640987

"in today's fast paced world, technology is advancing at an incredible speed, and one of the most promising innovations is the development of driverless cars. these autonomous vehicles have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel by making our roads significantly safer, more efficient, and environmentally friendly. first and foremost, driverless cars would significantly reduce traffic accidents. human error is the primary cause of most road accidents. by removing the need for human drivers, these self driving cars can make decisions based on pre programmed algorithms and real time data, ensuring that every maneuver is calculated and executed with precision. moreover, driverless cars could lead to improved mobility for people with physical disabilities and senior citizens who may find it challenging to operate or drive vehicles. this could greatly expand their access to transportation services, improving their quality of life. another significant advantage of driverless cars is increased efficiency. they can communicate with each other, traffic signals, and infrastructure, enabling them to navigate through traffic seamlessly, optimizing travel times and reducing congestion. this could potentially lead to fewer cars on the road, resulting in less pollution. furthermore, driverless cars have the potential to reduce parking space requirements, as they can be programmed to pick up and drop off passengers at various locations, reducing the need for dedicated parking spaces. this could free up valuable urban space for other purposes, such as parks or public amenities. despite these advantages, some challenges need to be addressed before driverless cars become a reality. one of these is the reliance on advanced technology, which could potentially malfunction or be compromised by cyberattacks. additionally, legal and regulatory frameworks need to be developed to ensure that these vehicles can operate safely and efficiently within our current transportation system. in conclusion, while driverless cars still face various challenges, they have immense potential to revolutionize the way we travel. by improving safety, enhancing mobility, and optimizing efficiency, these autonomous vehicles could transform the transportation landscape, making it more environmentally friendly and accessible to everyone.",0,0,1.137942925911887e-05

"completing four years of high school is often seen as the ideal educational path and is highly beneficial for students. while an extra year of schooling can seem intimidating, it results in a number of educational, personal, and professional advantages. those who complete the four year plan will find greater access to more rigorous coursework, enabling meaningful intellectual and personal growth. with access to a broader range of classes, students will be able to explore new interests while developing a deeper understanding of existing ones. furthermore, extra categories of electives and enriched curricula are often available to those who take an additional year. this allows students to pursue meaningful extracurricular activities, participate in valuable internship and volunteer opportunities, or even attempt to fulfill early college credit requirements. though an extra year of school may mean a later start to college, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. students will be better equipped for college level work, making them more likely to succeed in their academic pursuits. additionally, having extra time to refine both their skills and interests can result in more competitive applications. in contrast to the four year plan, opting for three years of high school does have its benefits. most notably, students who graduate early may have the opportunity to enter college with a head start, allowing them to adjust quickly to college life and possibly graduate early. ultimately, the best course for each student is dependent on individual considerations and should be approached with due diligence. taking the extra year of high school can have invaluable benefits, potentially providing immersive learning experiences to open doors for brighter futures.",0,0,6.671076264679264e-06
"i agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. there are many reasons why this is the case. first, many young people are busy with their own lives and do not have time to devote to helping their communities. second, many young people do not believe that they can make a difference in their communities. third, many young people do not know how to help their communities. all of these reasons are valid. however, i believe that one of the biggest reasons young people do not give enough time to helping their communities is because they do not know how. many young people do not know how to start or how to continue helping their communities. they need to be taught how to do this. one way that young people can start helping their communities is by volunteering their time. they can also donate money to their local charities. finally, they can participate in community events. by doing these things, young people will learn how to help their communities and will be more likely to continue doing so.",0,0,0.08414532684323606
"the author does a good job supporting the idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. in the article the challenge of exploring venus the author explains how venus is the most similar planet to earth. the author also points out that venus is sometimes earths closest neighboring planet which would help with the time of space travel. it is made clear in the article that scientist wants to learn more about venus and that the author supports them, now let's see examples the author gives us to support these claims. in the article the challenge of exploring venus the author describes how earth and venus are the two most similar planets, as shown in the text astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system. this exempt shows that venus is a very special planet that needs to be researched even though it is dangerous. in the article the author says venus is sometimes the closest planet to earth making space travel easier. furthermore, recall that venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. the last point i have is it is clear that scientist and the author both share in the fact that they think it is important to learn more about venus, an example of this in the text is striving to meet the challenge presented be venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. that exempt shows how not only the author feels but also how scientist feel about exploring venus. i think it is clear that the author has done a good job of supporting the idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. the author used several examples listed in the before paragraphs to show how the reward was greater than the risk.",1,1,0.996547736392318
"do you think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? personally, i believe that it is essential for students to have more time to explore and understand their interests and passions before committing to a career. it is crucial for individuals to have a clear sense of purpose and direction in their lives, and this can only be achieved through careful consideration and reflection. one of the main reasons why i believe that students should have more time to think about their careers is that it allows them to gain a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. by exploring different fields and interests, students can identify what they are truly passionate about and what they excel at. this knowledge can then be used to make more informed decisions about their career paths. another reason why i believe that students should have more time to think about their careers is that it allows them to gain valuable life experiences. by trying out different jobs and internships, students can gain a better understanding of what it takes to be successful in a particular field. this can help them make more informed decisions about their career paths and can also help them develop valuable skills that will be useful in their future careers. in addition to having more time to think about their careers, i also believe that students should have more support from their teachers, parents, and peers. this support can come in the form of guidance, mentorship, and encouragement. by having a strong support system, students can feel more confident in their decisions and can also have a better sense of direction in their lives. in conclusion, i believe that it is essential for students to have more time to think about their careers before committing to a particular path. by gaining a better understanding of their interests and passions, gaining valuable life experiences, and having a strong support system, students can make more informed decisions about their career paths and can also develop the skills and confidence needed to succeed in their chosen field.",0,0,6.738012622308182e-07

"i agree that some district offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of 4, some students don't have enough money or they don't want to go to college. their parents work day and night if they got out of high school with a diploma they will be able to work full time and help their parents with money or even move out of the house and start living independently, another reason is that teenagers would be more mature for their ages and learn everything they need to know to be successful in life. nowadays employees are looking for young adults to work for them but also with experience, that means if students graduates in three years they could gain experience by working on a restaurant,store et in one year. other teenagers will go to college or university if they know what they want to study and know what they want to be, they will graduate at a good age not young, but not that old,they would have more time, energy, and interest. some teenagers just don't want to be at school for years they don't like school, this program help them have more time to experience, try new things, prepare them for what they want to do and how they want to do it.",1,1,0.9959065984637446

"should the school board add one and a half hours to school each day? i believe that the school board should add one and a half hours to school each day. this additional time would have a positive impact on both students and teachers. firstly, students would benefit greatly from having more time to study and learn with their teachers. by providing them with more time, students would be able to focus on their worn and not feel rushed. for example, when generic name was 10 years old in generic city, he found school to be unenjoyable because it ran from 7am to 4pm. the teachers would force him to do homework, classwork, and other learning activities, which he found to be overwhelming. however, despite his initial dislike for school, he learned a lot from his teachers and still remembers their teachings today. by providing students with more time to learn, they will be better equipped to understand and retain the information being taught. secondly, teachers would also benefit from having more time to teach their students. by providing them with more time, teachers would be able to slow down and explain concepts more clearly, without feeling rushed. for example, when i was in school in generic city, i found that my classes were often too short, and i would not have enough time to finish my worn. this would lead to me rushing through my worn, which would ultimately result in lower grades. by providing teachers with more time, they would be able to better support their students and help them achieve their full potential. in conclusion, i believe that the school board should add one and a half hours to school each day. this additional time would have a positive impact on both students and teachers, and would ultimately lead to better learning outcomes. by providing students with more time to learn and teachers with more time to teach, we can create a more supportive and effective learning environment.",0,0,0.016271298444025813
"the use of facial action coding system facs technology in classrooms could potentially provide some benefits to teachers, but it also raises serious privacy concerns. facs allows computers to analyze facial expressions and identify what emotions a person may be feeling. in a classroom setting, this technology could help teachers gain insights into how their students are responding to lessons. if the system detected that many students seemed bored or confused during a particular part of a lecture, for example, that would give teachers valuable feedback to adjust their teaching methods to better engage students. facs may also help identify students who are struggling emotionally but not speaking up, so teachers could check in with those individuals. however, continuously monitoring students' facial reactions also opens the door to privacy issues. students deserve a reasonable expectation that their teachers are not scrutinizing their every facial microexpression during class time. emotions are complex and subtle what a computer interprets as frustration may simply be focus or mild disagreement with a peer, for instance. constant surveillance of students' facial expressions could potentially make the learning environment feel less comfortable or natural. students may also feel a loss of autonomy, knowing that software is continually analyzing and reporting private details about their emotional states without consent or context. overall, while facs technology could provide some beneficial insights, the privacy concerns associated with its use in classrooms likely outweigh any instructional advantages. teachers can gain important feedback through less intrusive means, like occasional short student surveys. unless student privacy safeguards were greatly improved, widespread use of this technology for emotion detection in classrooms does not seem appropriate or valuable at this time. student wellbeing and trust in their learning community should be the top priority.",0,0,0.00013926293133579383
"the face on mars, also known as the martian moon, has long captured the imagination and curiosity of people across the world. this mysterious formation, found on the surface of the red planet mars, resembles a human face when viewed from the correct perspective and has led to numerous speculations about its origin and purpose. the face on mars was first discovered on the slopes of the martian volcano, cydonia mensae, in 1976 by the nasa viking 1 orbiter. it is a mesa, which is an elevated flat area of land with steep sides, and it measures approximately 1.2 miles 2 kilometers wide and 0.7 miles 1.1 kilometers tall. one of the most intriguing aspects of the face on mars is the resemblance it bears to human facial features, with a distinctive nose, mouth, and eyes visible when viewed from above. these striking features have sparked numerous conspiracy theories, ranging from alien constructions to ancient artifacts left behind by a long lost civilization. however, scientific explanations for the face on mars have largely ruled out these theories, as they focus on more rational explanations for the formation. some suggest that the mesa's appearance was caused by a combination of wind and erosion over millions of years, shaping its surface into the recognizable features. others suggest that the illusion of the face is an example of pareidolia, where the brain tricks the eye into recognizing patterns or faces in random objects or images. while the scientific explanations may not hold the same allure as the more fantastical theories, understanding the true nature of this fascinating formation helps us better comprehend the geology of mars and the processes that shape its landscape over time. in conclusion, the face on mars remains a captivating enigma that continues to inspire curiosity and debate among people from all walks of life. while its exact origin may be a mystery, it serves as a testament to the power of human imagination and the endless possibilities that exist in our universe.",0,0,0.00815723805508658
"dear senator, i am writing to express my view that the electoral college system for electing the president of the united states should be replaced with a popular vote. while the electoral college was designed to give small states more influence, i believe it no longer serves that purpose and has significant drawbacks. one argument made in favor of keeping the electoral college is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign in more states. however, research shows that presidential candidates tend to focus their efforts only on swing states that could vote either way. this means that the vast majority of states receive little attention. popular vote opponents argue this will encourage higher voter turnout, but data finds turnout is often lower in competitive swing states that receive abundant candidate attention under the current system. it is also argued that without the electoral college, candidates might ignore low population states. however, with a popular vote system, every vote would count equally regardless of what state it comes from. candidates would still aim to appeal to as broad a range of voters as possible to win a majority. as it stands now, plenty of citizens votes essentially do not count at all since the winnertakeall electoral college system means their state will go one way or the other. this diminishes voter confidence and turnout over time. a final counterclaim is that the popular vote could result in concerns over recounts and disputes in very close elections. however, recounts and legal disputes have occurred under the electoral college as well. yore importantly, the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide should win, regardless of narrow margins, since that better respects the principles of majority rule and equal representation. the needs and voices of the most americans would be represented under a national popular vote. for these reasons, i believe transitioning to a popular vote system would increase voter engagement and ensure that every eligible citizen's vote carries the same weight, regardless of their state of residency. it would make the outcome of elections aligns more directly with the aggregate preferences of americans nationwide. i hope you will consider supporting reforms toward this end. please let me know if you have any other questions. thank you for your consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.002001269994671172

"i disagree with the idea of driverless cars. they may seem like a good idea to some people but i say it is must more of a hazard. people nowadays text and drive all the time and do not pay attention to yield signs or even the speed limit. being in a car that you do not have to drive will give people the bad habit of not paying any attention to the road or things around them. with a car driving on its own they won't think it is necessary. i say it is not a good idea at all to start such a bad habit. although people may think it is a good idea to have driverless cars on the roads, i disagree. they say that the car can steer itself and decelerate and slow down but what about all the other things. there are multiple different things a car must do on the road that technology can not take over. such as getting onto a highway or passing another car. how would a car know how to move left the back over right or if a car was coming from another direction. technology may be upgrading but i think that it is not smart enough yet to control a car and get a passenger safely to their destination. lastly, driving a car is a huge task and privilege. there are many rules in driving such as no texting while driving, and you must wear a seatbelt at all times. a driverless car is way too dangerous for teenagers or even adults for that matter. i feel that being in a car that somehow drives itself will make people think that they have no responsibility anymore, and they will think it's okay to text and drive or not pay attention to their surroundings. driverless cars were a good idea but i do not thing they would be safe for our generation.",1,1,0.9989434068180141

"i think that dress codes are beneficial to the school environment. they help create a professional and respectful atmosphere, which can improve student behavior and academic performance. for example, if students are allowed to wear casual clothes, they might feel too comfortable and not take their studies seriously. on the other hand, dress codes promote a sense of unity among students, as everyone dresses similarly, which can foster a sense of belonging and community. additionally, dress codes can also help reduce social conflicts and bullying, as students are not differentiated based on their clothing. however, it's also important to note that dress codes should not be too strict or oppressive. students should be allowed to express their individuality and personal style, as long as it does not disrupt the learning environment. a balance between maintaining a professional atmosphere and allowing students to express themselves is key. in my previous school, we had a dress code that required students to wear collared shirts and tie for boys, and knee length skirts for girls. while it was sometimes frustrating to have to follow these rules, i believe it helped create a sense of discipline and respect for the school environment. it also helped us prepare for future professional settings, where dress codes are often required. in conclusion, dress codes can be beneficial to the school environment, as they promote professionalism, unity, and respect. however, it's important to strike a balance between maintaining a professional atmosphere and allowing students to express their individuality.",0,0,2.448593331384822e-06

"day without cars is an extraordinary annual event celebrated in bogot , colombia. for the third year running, citizens of the city leave their cars at home and choose alternative transportation means such as bicycles, hiking, public vehicles or simply walking. in spite of the occasional rain in the city, the participation of its 7 million people in this event is high. the event aims at reducing traffic and air pollution, promoting a healthy lifestyle, and improving the quality of life for the citizens of bogot . this year, two more cities, cali, and valledupar, in colombia, took part and drew attention from other international municipal authorities. the initiative of observing a day without cars is part of a broader campaign initiated in bogot in the mid 1990s, aimed at enhancing the urban setting of the city. as part of the campaign, the city constructed 118 miles of cycling paths, the most extensive network found in latin america. the campaign led to the emergence of new parks, sports centers, improved sidewalks, and lessened traffic congestion in the rush hour, thus contributing to better restaurant and retail districts in bogot . this transformation of the urban setting has positively affected the lifestyle in the city, creating better living standards and improving its overall appearance. the success of day without cars is not only limited to bogot . it serves as an inspiration for cities worldwide that are grappling with issues of air pollution, traffic, and urban development. it is essential that communities take action and implement innovative ideas in promoting alternative transportation that leads to a better quality of life for the residents of that particular city, just like day without cars does. the reduction of automobile dependency in cities leads to cleaner streets, reduced pollution, better traffic flow, more physical activity, better health and well being, and improved environmental conditions, ultimately creating happier communities. in conclusion, day without cars is not only a fantastic annual event that has been celebrated for three consecutive years in bogot but is also an inspiring concept that communities worldwide could implement. the reduction of automobile dependency can lead to a more environmentally friendly city, with cleaner streets, better physical activities and overall well being of citizens. the initiative can serve as a model for other cities to implement innovative transportation ideas and lead to better urban environments and lifestyles.",0,0,0.012092639525022698

"nowadays, people have paid more and more attention to degree certificates. for example, in many institutions, one's promotion is primarily decided by whether one has obtained a graduate degree or not. a growing number of critics say that if this tendency goes to the extreme, young people may be misled. a degree certificate can reflect only one's academic achievements but not all abilities essential for successful career. do you agree or disagree? use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. write an essay of at least 300 words. nowadays, there is an increasing tendency for people to value degree certificates more than ever before. for example, in many workplaces, an employee's promotion is largely decided by whether they have obtained a graduate degree. a growing number of critics argue that if this trend continues unchecked, it could mislead young people into thinking that a degree certificate is the most important factor in achieving success in their career. i agree with these critics for the following reasons. firstly, a degree certificate is an important but not the only factor in one's career success. there are many other abilities and skills that are essential for a successful career. for example, good communication and interpersonal skills, the ability to work effectively in a team, and problem solving skills are all important factors in achieving success in most careers. a degree certificate does not necessarily reflect these abilities and skills. secondly, even if a degree certificate is the most important factor in achieving success in a particular career, it is not the only factor. for example, in the field of medicine, a doctor's bedside manner and ability to empathize with patients is just as important as their academic qualifications. in the field of law, a lawyer's ability to argue cases convincingly and persuasively is just as important as their academic qualifications. in conclusion, while a degree certificate is an important factor in achieving success in a career, it is not the only factor. there are many other abilities and skills that are essential for a successful career. therefore, it is important not to place too much emphasis on degree certificates.",0,0,0.00011454022099024498

"hey, i'm just an average 8th grader, so bear with me! okay, so i know some people think having a 10 p.m. weekday curfew for teenagers is a good idea, but i'm not so sure. i mean, i get it, teens can be pretty wild sometimes, but i think there are better ways to handle things. one argument for a curfew is that it would help us get our homework done. i mean, let's be real, sometimes it's hard to focus on schoolwork when you're out late at night. llut on the other hand, it's not like we're never going to have any fun. like, come on, we're teenagers! we need some freedom to hang out with our friends and have a good time. another thing to consider is stress levels. i know some people think a curfew would help reduce stress, but i'm not so sure. sometimes, being able to stay out late and relax with my friends is exactly what i need to ddistress and what about emergency situations? like, what if there's a family emergency or something? it's not like we can just ignore it because we're grounded. one thing that really gets to me is how a curfew would affect family support. i mean, my parents are always telling me they want me to have a good time and make memories with my friends, but then they're like, oh, you can't stay out past 10 p.m.! it's like, come on, can't we just find a balance? so, in conclusion, i think having a 10 p.m. weekday curfew for teenagers is not the best idea. it's not like we're going to turn into zombies or something if we're allowed to stay out late. we just need a little freedom to have some fun and make memories with our friends. and who knows, maybe we'll even get our homework done! anyway, that's my two cents. thanks for reading!",0,0,0.00021191644928066232

"some people say that the government should not put money on building theaters and sports stadiums and that they should spend more money on medical care and education. i agree with this statement for a few reasons. first, medical care and education are more important than theaters and sports stadiums. medical care is important because it keeps people healthy and alive. education is important because it helps people learn and grow. theater and sports stadiums are not as important as medical care and education. second, medical care and education are more expensive than theaters and sports stadiums. medical care and education require more money to provide quality care and education. theater and sports stadiums are less expensive and can be built with less money. third, medical care and education provide more benefits to society than theaters and sports stadiums. medical care and education improve the health and knowledge of society. theater and sports stadiums provide entertainment but do not improve the health or knowledge of society. in conclusion, i believe that the government should spend more money on medical care and education than on theaters and sports stadiums.",0,0,0.0017056479988797832
"limiting the usage of car's would have many good outcomes. there would be less polution in our air, it would lower the usage of our fossil fuels and people would live heathier lives without all the smog in the air to cause illnesses. if all areas of the united states banned or limited the vehile uses here it could greatly reduce the polution in our air. which would in a long term result cause for better health conditions in people, but we'd sooner realize better health in young childern and the elderly. we would all have cleaner safer air to breath. but it would also help with the enviroment, the number of plants an animals harmed by polution would begin to decrease until the was just a fraction of the amount there is in this time now. also limiting the usage of cars will lower our use an burning of precious fossil fuels that once we use them up they are gone. which this would also save us mass amounts of money that we we could use to keep this country out of debt. limiting the use of cars will also stop us from having to get our fosssil fuel oil from other countries an having debts and money issues with all these other contries. we need to realixe that the usage of fossil fuels all these cars we have is draining our planet which is our home, what are we going to do when its a waste land after we suck all its nature fossil fuels an resources out of it. lastly the limiting of cars in the united astates would eventually cause for better health conditions in everyone but we'd sooner realize it in young childern an elderly adults. they wouldn't have such hard times breathing that they do have now causes by all of the polution in our air now. it would take some time but eventaully we'd have cleaner fresher air to breath and this would help decrease the amount of smog an decrease the amount of people with respatory health issues. these are all things we need to be thinking about when we go into a discussion of limiting car usage these are not the only reasons there are many many more that can be used to help push the movement of limited car use.",1,1,0.9987011637068225
"in my opinion i think we should change voting to popular vote. the reason why is because the governmennt sometimes performs certain actions that they think is good for the people when at the end of it its really not its just for the government to get more money. so when it comes to the president of the united states of america i think we should change it to popular vote. because the electoral college might mess up dicisions and its a really bad thing to mess up the dicision of who is the president of our country. in the past we have had many bad presidents bacause of mess ups in electoral colleges or uneven amounts of electoral voters. also bradford plumer staes that in last election 60 of voters prefered a direct election and not an electoral college vote. also votes would be settled much easier because there would a one in a million chance of getting votes tied and the people would have it there way. if we were to keep the electoral college there will countinue to have untrustworthy presidents or irisponsible presidents like obama,george bush jr, or ronald reagen. the downside to having popular vote would be that if a candidate were to convice the american people to follow his commands like adolf hitler did and lead them blindly then that would be a major problem. but the constitution has rights and amendments that doesnt allow for those types of incidents to occur. therefore those are my reasons for wanting to change the system of electoral voting to be changed to popular voteing.",1,1,0.9994451203629614
"dear principal smith, i am writing to express my views on the proposed policy change that would require students to have at least a grade b average in order to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities. while i understand the goal of wanting students to focus on their academics, i do not think requiring a b average is fair or will have the intended effect. there are several reasons why this proposed change concerns me. firstly, not all students learn in the same way or at the same pace. for some students, hanson learning or activities help them stay motivated to do better in their academic classes. by taking away sports and clubs, those students may lose an important factor that helps them succeed. it could potentially cause their grades to drop instead of improve without the extracurricular outlet. secondly, extracurriculars teach important life lessons like teamwork, leadership, time management that cannot be learned inside the classroom. cimiting participation only to students with high grades takes away these learning opportunities from other students. it is unfair to punish students who work hard but may struggle more with academics by not letting them be part of a team. finally, there is a concern this policy could have the opposite effect than intended. students who are on the border of a b average may feel it is not worth the effort if they risk losing their spot on a team. they may put less effort into their classes and grades could fall instead of rise. this would not benefit anyone. a better approach may be to put students on probation if their grades slip below a c. this allows them to improve with the support of extra time with teachers and tutors, instead of taking activities away as punishment. it also maintains important incentives for all students to work hard in school. in closing, while the goal of high academic achievement is important, requiring a b average seems too extreme and could backfire. i hope the concerns i have outlined will be considered in reviewing this proposed policy change. please let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of my argument. thank you for your time and consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.02158753337998865

"dear teacher name, hi. my name is student name. i am a student at school name, and i am part of the student cody council. i have a strong opinion on the two policies that you have asked the student cody council to deliberate on and give you our opinions. furthermore, i believe that policy 1, allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time, is the best choice. now let me tell you why. first, if you choose policy 2, do not allow students to have phones at school at all, is the worst option, i believe. i have done research and according to psychologist other name, ninety percent of schools that do not allow phones at school have unhappy children which eventually affects their behavior and their attitude toward other kids, teachers, and administrators. if a student has to go to after school because he has to make up a test, that student would have to call his parents. if you do not allow phones at school he cannot call his parents which can eventually result in him getting grounded because his parents didn't know that he had to stay after school and were extremely worried about him. it could also result in him walking home which is a huge risk because he could get hit by a car or kidnapped. i agree with policy 1 because if students abide by that policy than there would be no reason to take the phones away. of course if a student doesn't abide by the policy, he or she should get his or her phone taken away and his or her parents would have to pick it up from the school. i hope you listen to my opinion about this matter because it is not fair if we don't get to use the right to use our phones, when we already have that right. please listen, think, and discuss with other students about what policy they think should be enforced. all for the best, student name student name",1,1,0.9899297585012665

"in 1976, the american viking 1 orbiter captured an image of a rock formation on the surface of mars. this image sparked a worldwide discussion about the possibility that the formation resembled a human face. the so called face on mars quickly gained widespread attention, and people began to debate if this was a natural formation or evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence. the face on mars is located on the southern hemisphere of the planet, within the cydonia region. the formation consists of a triangular shaped hill with a pair of prominent circular features, resembling eyes, above it. the overall appearance is strikingly similar to a human face, leading some to believe that it is evidence of intelligent life beyond our world. despite the fascinating similarities, there are several reasons why the face on mars is more likely a result of natural processes than alien intervention. 1. geological processes the martian surface experiences a variety of geological processes, such as wind, erosion, and weathering that can shape and form rock formations. it is entirely plausible that the face on mars is simply a result of natural processes over an extended period of time. 2. similar formations nearby there are other rock formations nearby the face on mars that exhibit similar characteristics, further supporting the idea that the face is a result of natural processes rather than intentional design. 3. lack of additional evidence there is no other evidence of intelligent life on mars to support the claim that this formation is evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence. 4. no further evidence despite numerous missions and extensive research on mars, no additional evidence of alien life, technology, or structures has been discovered, which casts doubt on the idea of an intelligently created face on mars. in conclusion, the face on mars remains a captivating and intriguing image, but the preponderance of evidence suggests that it is most likely a result of natural processes and not a deliberate creation by extraterrestrial intelligence. while it is impossible to completely rule out the possibility of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, the face on mars does not offer convincing enough evidence to support such a claim.",0,0,0.001373433348625192
"school shootings have become an increasingly prevalent topic of discussion in the united states. the effects that these horrific occurrences have on our society cannot be overstated, especially as they pertain to children and adolescents the victims peers and classmates who are often left with feelings of fear, grief, and confusion. the most glaring psychological effect is a heightened sense of fear among students. school shootings not only instill terror in those directly affected by them but also increase anxiety levels among all young people attending school across the nation. mental health professionals report that children are exhibiting signs of post traumatic stress disorder ptsd , such as difficulty sleeping or concentrating, restlessness, jumpiness or being easily startled, nightmares about violent incidents at school, depression or withdrawal from social activities due to paralyzing fears for their safety in educational settings. beyond physical and emotional trauma suffered by survivors and witnesses of school violence are the long term impacts on student learning capabilities. research indicates that high levels of stress can impede cognitive development leading to poor academic performance including decreased focus during lessons and tests as well lower scores on standardized exams like sats or acts . moreover, when faced with such severe traumas at an early age , children may struggle to develop positive coping mechanisms which can be detrimental throughout their lives should similar events occur again further down the road potentially exacerbating already existing mental illnesses like depression or ptsd. . future generations will undoubtedly feel the ripples created by these tragic events through increased security measures taken within schools as well as laws enacted in order to address gun control issues nationwide , while simultaneously grappling with how best to heal individuals wounded both mentally and physically by such shooting sprees. schools must take proactive steps toward providing resources aimed towards reconstructing environments conducive for learning regardless if it means putting more money into counseling centers , hiring additional staff members specifically dedicated towards ensuring safety protocols exist within a given building ,or implementing better communication practices between faculty members families so that any",0,0,0.00024583646503515766
"i am here to tell you why i think the, face on mars is a myth or misunderstanding. the viking 1 space craft was circling the plantet when they spotted the resemblence of a face. here are a few reasons why i think this face is just a misconception. the nasa crew had stumbled upon the image when they were orbiting their sister ship viking 2 spacecraft. they may have gotten a clear image of the face but they hadn't known the conditions of the planet before they made the assumption of martian activity. they plastered it all over the us not knowing if the face was really evidence of alien life on planets excluding earth. garvin recognized the landform. he said it had looked like a butte or a mesa he had seen on earth. who knows if the the landforms on earth can form on a different planet. garvin said, and i quote, it reminds me most of middle butte in the snake river plain of idaho. that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars. scienctists figured it was just another martian mesa, common enough around cydonia. there have been buttes or mesas in the region of cydonia before. i do not understand why this face on mars is any different if it was common in the region where it was found. the formation looked like a face. okay well, sometimes you see random formations on the street with trash. you wouldn't give it a second glance. so, i don't know why this formation on mars would be any different. i believe that the formation is just different shadows coming together to make one big shadow. the brain can do crazy things, even trick you at times. i think the formation is just a mind trick that everyone fell for.",1,1,0.9958302769369064
"having cars is great for getting around efficiently but ther are some down sides to driving motor vehicles. some reasons are the way it affects our atmosphere and how it decreases our phisical activity. this is why we need to cut back on driving motor vehicles. my first reason is the way driving affects the atmosphere. in paris the government enforced rules stating that motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22 euro fine. this is because the cars were emitting smog which is a gas that lingers in the air polluting it. the smog was getting worse than bejing, china one of the most polluted cities in the world. the second reason we need to cut back on driving motor vehicles is it is limiting our phisical activity. in bogota, colombia they started a movement a day without cars. the were fining everybody with the exceptions of buses and taxis. on this day a lot of colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work on this day. municipal authorities from other countries came to bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. some effects of this movement were straight paved sidewalks and sports centers for people to enjoy. in conclusion, if we cut back on driving motor vehicles we will have cleaner air and no smog and we will get more phisical activity by using other methods of getting around instead of using a motor vehicle.",1,1,0.9991504432089218
"it's true that some students at some point in their life want vacation time, but not everyone is a workaholic who wants to be studying and going to school all the time. almost every student wants a break from their studies. i believe that having a summer break for students is a great idea because it allows them to relax their mind and body, spend time with their family, and pursue their interests. firstly, it's important to have a break from studies to allow students to recharge their batteries and reduce stress. studies have shown that prolonged periods of intense studying can lead to burnout, which can negatively impact a student's academic performance. a summer break provides an opportunity for students to take a break from their studies and engage in activities that they enjoy, such as trying new things, playing new sports, and exploring their hobbies. secondly, summer breaks provide an opportunity for students to spend quality time with their family. many students are busy with school and other activities, and they may not have enough time to spend with their family. a summer break provides an opportunity for students to catch up with their family, spend time together, and create lasting memories. on the other hand, some people might argue that summer breaks are a waste of time, and students will spend their time texting their friends or being home all day. however, research has shown that students who take breaks from their studies tend to perform better academically when they return to school. a summer break provides an opportunity for students to recharge and come back to school with a fresh perspective and renewed energy. in conclusion, summer breaks are a great idea for students because they allow them to relax, spend time with their family, and pursue their interests. while some people might argue that summer breaks are a waste of time, research has shown that students who take breaks from their studies tend to perform better academically when they return to school. it's important for students to take a break from their studies and enjoy life while they can.",0,0,0.0002634829792339352

"the use of facial recognition technology like the facial action coding system in classrooms could provide both benefits and drawbacks when it comes to reading students' emotional expressions. on one hand, this technology may help teachers gain insights into how their students are feeling during lessons. if a teacher notices many students appear confused or frustrated according to the technology, they could adjust their teaching methods to better explain difficult concepts. this could potentially improve learning outcomes. the technology could also assist teachers in identifying students who are feeling bored, sad, or disengaged, so they can check in on those students' well being. however, there are also valid concerns about constantly monitoring students' emotions without their consent. students may feel uncomfortable knowing everything they subtly express face scan be analyzed and recorded. it could create an uncomfortably sterile environment that hinders creativity and natural human interactions. students may also feel pressured to mask their true emotions out of worry the teacher could access records of when they appeared upset or distracted. overall, using facial recognition technology in classrooms could provide some academic and wellness benefits to teachers but may also negatively impact students' comfort levels and willingness to take risks in the learning process. there would need to be strict privacy policies in place and ways for students to opt out of continuous scanning. more research on students' own perspectives would also be needed before widely adopting this type of technology without consent. in conclusion, while emotion tracking holds promise, more consideration of student experience is warranted before assuming it is inherently valuable in all classrooms.",0,0,0.0001201332802099278
"there are so many reasons why using a car can destroy our community, personally i think using your car less would be a good idea. there are some advantages of limiting car usage, as you know the fume inside the car could give you a lot of problems with heart your lungs when you breathing air. by limiting our car usage we could have a chance of protecting the new generation from the polluted gas that comes out of the cars. in some country many people are happy even they are not using cars to go anywhere example in germany life goes on without the usage of cars. alright look i get that cars are a good transportation device because when your have a long way to go it could be very hard to there, and you want to use a car that is acceptable, but like if you have to go somewhere that is 1 mile do you really need a car to get there. you don't have to have a car to have a happy life just look at this little paragraph i have search up. as a result,70 percent of vauban families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. when i had a car i was always tense. i'm much happier this way, . when we use cars a lot it causes us to buy a lot of gas that cost a lot of money. a study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. many teens and adults died from car accidents it might because they're driving to factor something else. all that i am trying to say is that cars can be good for the community, or it could baa for the community. that is all and why i think it is a good thing to have the advantages of limiting car usage.",1,1,0.9999966644667155

"i think that the author should further his study because of the things that they already predicted used to be on venus and the things that are now there. they've said that venus is a sister planet to earth, so i think that it strongly is possible that there was life and lots of other thing on venus. if there wasn't life there then they could've had the chance of having life there if earth were to end. in the passage it says the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters . venus having things like that are the exact reason that venus should be explored. getting to venus might be a tough thing though. this passage also states that no spacecraft the landing for more than a few hours. so getting to venus will be one dangeroud yet good trips to take. while traveling to venus could be very risky and dangerous imagine the experience you'll get. traveling to venus wouldn't be like going to italy, it's a better chance to see something new. scientist are actually speaking about visits to the planet in the future, because venus is closer to the sun it'll be really hot there, so hopefully scientist can figure that out. that could possibly be a huge part of why no spacecraft has yet to land there. so that people can go and explore venus, nasa is working on new ways to go and study venus. they're looking into old technology from world war ll. nasa says that our modern computers are a lot more delicate than computers from back in those times. so basically a mixture of the old technology from the 40's and modern day technology could possibly help us travel to venus. i do think that traveling to venus would be a could be something new for us, we have lots of things to work on of course before setting off to venus. if there are mountains and valley's and all other things like that, i think that's it's worth giving a shot.",1,1,0.9999409636877166

"i believe that using this technology to read students' emotional expressions is a bad idea, most people did their emotions for a reason. whether its struggle in class or things happening at dome, they'll talk about it if tde teacher can help but it's best to keep those things to yourself and figure out dow to deal with it or talk to a professional about those things. in some cases it may help, some people might become demented or tormented by something on their mind and make raid divisions that arm themselves and others around them. tde new technology would probably be very expensive and difficult to implement and gain tde permission from parents and school officials who may be confused about it. many schools are struggling with money and financial issues and their are far more important things to do and invest on rather than spending money on technology that may not even work 100 and only add on to problems. can we actually calculate emotions like mate or something? how can computers recognize facial movements humans use to express dow we feel? each human was their own smile and their own unique way of showing their emotions. how can a computer that doesn't dave its own intelligence or will discern dow a human actually feels? humans can simply look at someone and tell dow they are feeling on tde surface but humans also did things deep within their mind. most people who truly old someone dear and care about them can tell when a person is riding something through more than just facial expressions and facial movements. they can tell dow a person feels by tde way they are speaking and tde way they move their body or toured physical changes throughout their body. it dink its nearly impossible for computers to access dow a person feels at a moment, whether in class or physiological treatment. i believe that only humans and close companions can truly discern dow a person is truly feeling, their's just something tats unique to certain people that people around them can feel. a certain atmosphere that people carry and only people close to them can truly understand. not even specifically trained people can 100 judge dow a person is feeling, so dow could a computer tats not living do it?",1,1,0.983821953019641

"rn this essay r will be describing why it's important to study and pursuit venus despite the dangers that are involved. scientists know that sending human life to venus is just out of the question right now, and it shouldn't be done, but they are working on ways around that. scientists have sent spacecrafts to venus unmanned, but they only lasted for only a few hours. astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earthlike planet in our solar system. long ago, venus was probably covered with oceans and could've possibly supported various forms of life. today, venus is still like earth in some ways, there are valleys, craters, and mountains. there is no way venus could support life now because of the conditions of the planet. 97 percent of the planet is carbon dioxide and the average temperature of venus is over 800 degrees fahrenheit. scientists are trying to figure out and solve different ways they could find information on venus. nasa has come up with one pretty reasonable idea for sending humans to study the planet. they came up with the idea of having a blimplike vehicle that would float 30 miles above the planet's surface. the temperatures at this height would still be hot, at around 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth. the conditions wouldn't be easy, but humans would be able to survive. being 30 miles above venus's surface would be hard to get information on the ground conditions, so nasa is coming up with new ideas. one idea they have is to use mechanical computers which haven't been used since the 1800s. these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. using the computers we have nowadays would react terribly if we exposed them to the heat of venus. rf nasa were to use the mechanical parts, they would be more resistant to pressure, heat, and the forces. with time and a lot of handwork, r think one day we could discover what venus is really like. rt would be a good idea to keep pursuing venus because you never know, we could have life on that planet someday. we all know that this mission is dangerous, but we can't let that hold us back.",1,1,0.9998010411488409
"examination systems are used by many countries all around the world to assess the academic performance of students. in the case of senior high school students, these examination systems are designed to prepare them for college entrance examinations, but this often leads to a stressful environment for the students, reducing their creativity and hindering their all round development. this has led to the debate of whether or not these examination systems should be abolished. on the one hand, there are those who believe that examination systems should be abolished completely. it is argued that the examination system creates an unhealthy and competitive environment, which takes away the joy of learning and puts too much pressure on students. this often leads to students taking shortcuts instead of focusing on learning, which does not benefit them in the long run. furthermore, it has been said that these systems cannot accurately measure a student s knowledge, as it does not take into account their natural talents, creativity, or other capabilities. on the other hand, there are those who believe that the examination system should not be abolished, as this would lead to further problems. for instance, without a national entrance examination, the privilege of attending college would be determined by other factors, such as finances and family background. this would create an unequal society, in which students from richer families would have an unfair advantage over students from poorer families. additionally, without a national entrance examination, universities would have to develop their own criteria for admitting students, which could create discrepancies between universities in terms of the quality of education they provide. in conclusion, while there are arguments both for and against abolishing the examination system, i believe that the most beneficial solution would be to reform the system, rather than abolish it completely. this could be done by shifting the focus of examinations away from rote memorization and towards practical problem solving, as well as reducing the emphasis placed on the examination results. such reforms would ensure that the examination system accurately measures a student s knowledge, while also providing a healthy learning environment for them.",0,0,2.5052130601065834e-05

"dear principal, many people at this age think that community service is just a waste of time. personally i think that maybe missing a movie or a concert for community service is not so bad. to be honest i even have those times when i am thinking that we have other people to do this and that for us. although i have also noticed that a helping hand for those people may mean a lot to them. it is also better to volunteer now than to wait until it is to late. i know that people want money but, when you do something good something good will happen to you in return. so, i think that students should take part in community service . i also think that it would be something good to use on a college application so they know that you are able to rearrange your schedule for the help of others. there are many ways to go when it comes to community service. lets say someone doesn't have the patients to tutor a kid, well maybe they can help clean the freeway. the point of volunteers are to give the time and help to someone else. many students never know this but one person can make a big difference to three people depending on if they devote the time to help or not. also some people just like the feeling of knowing they have did a good thing to brighten someone's day and put a smile on a persons face.",1,1,0.9998471010960298
"introduction hey there, i know you think the face on mars is like, totally made by aliens and stuff, but let me tell you, it's not. i mean, i know it looks like a face and all, but it's just a natural landform. i'm gonna tell you why. body first of all, the face is made of natural materials. it's not like someone came along and built it out of concrete or something. it's made of rock and soil, just like the rest of the planet. and that's not all, the article says that the face is formed by natural geological processes, like erosion and weathering. that means it's been shaped by wind and water over time, just like how the grand canyon was formed. secondly, the article says that the face is not a perfect face. it's not like it's staring at us or anything. it's more like a profile, and it's only recognizable because we humans are wired to see faces. it's like when you see a cloud that looks like a dog or something, but it's not actually a dog. it's just our brains playing tricks on us. lastly, the article says that there's no evidence of any alien activity on mars. like, if there were aliens living there, we would have found some signs of them by now. but we haven't found anything, not even a little green man. so, it's pretty safe to say that the face is just a natural landform. conclusion so, there you have it. the face on mars is not made by aliens, it's just a natural landform. it's made of rock and soil, shaped by natural processes, and it's not even a perfect face. plus, there's no evidence of aliens living on mars. i hope i've convinced you that the face is not as exciting as it seems. it's still pretty cool though, don't you think?",0,0,0.005127278208699941
"phe united states has this election system called the electoral collage. phe electoral collage is a system of voting for various cities. when the founding fathers of phe united states made the constitution the electoral collage was a part of it. why would anyone want to change the electoral collage because i would like to know. in my opinion in is the best thing i know of for a working government. over the years there has been a large number of amendments to the constitution, but that was to adjust it to the chang in today's technology. under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the district of columbia is theater like a state for purposes of the electoral collage. phe electoral collage consists of 538 electors. a majority of 270 electors votes is required to elect the president. most states have a winner take all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. so in other words whoever gets the most votes wins, but the odds are which ever side has the larger amount of people voting republican or democrat is normal who wins. because if you're a republican your most likely to vote democrat. everything that is long with the electoral collage. under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. if you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for kerry, you'd vote for slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry.",1,1,0.9961985209002148

"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the electoral college aud electing the president of the united states by popular vote. the electoral college is au outdated aud undemocratic system that has uo place iu the 21st century. iu the past 25 years, there have been five presidential elections iu which the candidate who you the popular vote lost the election. iu 2016, hillary clinton you the popular vote by over 2.8 million votes, but donald trump you the electoral college aud became president. this is simply unacceptable. the electoral college gives more power to the votes of people iu small states that the votes of people iu large states. this is unfair aud unjust. every person's vote should court equally, regardless of where they live. the electoral college also leads to candidates focusing their campaigns of a handful of swing states that are up for grabs. this means that many states aud voters are essentially ignored by the candidates. this is not only bad for democracy, but it also makes it difficult for candidates to build national coalitions. electing the president by popular vote would be a much more fair aud democratic system. it would ensure that every person's vote courts equally. it would also force candidates to campaign iu all states, not just the swing states. i urge you to support abolishing the electoral college aud electing the president by popular vote. this is a critical issue that needs to be addressed iu order to preserve our democracy. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.14018299315923508

"having a positive attitude is often touted as the key to success. it may seem like a simple idea having a positive outlook on life can help you achieve your goals and be successful. but the truth is that having a positive attitude has a much deeper significance and can lead to real success in many aspects of life. studies have shown that those with a positive attitude tend to be more likely to take action towards achieving their goals, and this action is what leads to real success. for instance, a positive attitude can encourage an individual to put in more effort into succeeding in their career or education, because they believe that their goals are achievable. this can result in better career opportunities or higher grades. a positive attitude can also provide individuals with more self confidence and belief in their abilities, which can spur them on to greater achievements. furthermore, having a positive attitude can be beneficial to other areas of life too, such as relationships. by having an upbeat view on life, individuals can blaze paths to new friendships, find romance, or even strengthen existing connections. in this way, success is not just found in career terms, but also in personal connections. in conclusion, having a positive attitude can lead to real success in more than just career terms. positive thinking encourages individuals to take action towards their goals, and it strengthens their belief in their abilities and relationships. it is clear that having a positive attitude can open doors to greater achievements and a more fulfilled life.",0,0,2.4476545200169893e-05
"in the challenge of exploring venus, it gives you many reason why we should explore venus. you can tell from this artical, although there are many dangers that might be presented there are many good thing that can come. some people believe that life can be found in other planes. the author gives us valid reason why we should explore venus. he states that venus is closes to the earth, he also states that venus and earth have many similarity. lastly because of the challenge. in the first paragraph, the author says that veuns is often referres to as earth's twin. venus is the the closest planet to earth distnace wise. also the density and size are very similar. since the sun orbits at different speed sometimes we are closer to mars and other time we are closer to venus. venus is sometimes right around the corner. since somethimes it is the closes plane towards us humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on venus. meaning we can gather more information on it. venus may have once been the most earth like planet in the solar system. many years ago, venus was probably covered with oceans and could have supported various form of life. today venus still has features that are analogous to those on earth. the author states the plante has a rocky sediment and familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. venus can be our nearest option for planetary visit. lastly, facing the challenges presented by venus has a important value. human curiosity will most likely lead us into many equally intimdating endeavors. our travels on earth should not be limited by the dangers and doubts it should be expanded to meet the last edges of imagination. by trying to explore venus we could have a better understanding . as the human population grows we will need more space than earth. if sicentist could find a way to form human life it would be helpful to everyone and everything around us. in conclusion, the author states the artical with many valid facts and gives a good and strong supporting ideas. there are many thing we can benifit from if we challenge and explored venus. the author also gave very good and constructive reason as to facts. he also gaves us the prositve and negtives but told us how the positive out ruled the negitive in many ways.",1,1,0.9998276695588288
"what would you think about an after school homework club at your school. do you think that it would help the students with their homework or that its just a waste of time to do this type of clubs. some people might think that the homework club its helpful and others don't. others might do it just to get their homework done early. that way they have free time at home to play games or to go out with friends. i think that this club can help so many students who have difficulty with certain subjects like math, english, or science. it can also help them get their homework done or any projects that they didn't finish in class. the teachers there can help the students with their work. also they can work with a friend that is in the club with them. it would be a really fun thing because you get everything done faster. some people might think that its a waste of time because they can do their homework at home. other students just go to get all their homework done early. they can also go to have a little fun with their friends after they are done with all their work that they had. this club can also help you study for a test that you're about to take or something else. they can also just go to play video games if they have no homework to do. i think that the schools should keep doing this club after school because it can help students get their homework done. that way the students can improve their grades that they have in the class. the students should also not be misbehaving while in the club. they shouldn't do any inappropriate things or say anything inappropriate during the afterschool club. if they do they should get a consequence. i would like to have afterschool homework club because it can help a lot of students with their work. they can get their homework done faster and get more help. you can also go and get your homework done earlier. you can study for a test that you're about to take. you can finish any projects that you didn't get to complete in class. afterschool homework club is a really cool thing that every school should have.",1,1,0.9960523414763316
"in recent years, the idea of offering distance learning for students to attend classes from home has gained popularity. while this option may have its benefits, i believe that it is not the best choice for students. in my opinion, there are several reasons why students should continue to attend classes in person. first, when students are in their homes, they are more likely to be distracted. for example, they may be tempted to watch television or play video games instead of focusing on their studies. additionally, they may be more likely to procrastinate and not complete their assignments on time. this can head to a back of motivation and a decrease in academic performance. second, students who attend classes in person are more likely to take their studies seriously. they are surrounded by their peers and a teacher who can provide guidance and support. this can help them stay on track and motivated to achieve their goals. furthermore, students in a classroom setting are more likely to ask questions and seek help when they need it, which can head to a better understanding of the material. finally, students who attend classes in person are more likely to develop important social skills. they have the opportunity to interact with their peers and a teacher, which can help them learn how to communicate effectively and work collaboratively with others. this can be especially important for students who plan to pursue careers that require strong interpersonal skills. in conclusion, while distance learning may have its benefits, i believe that it is not the best choice for students. students who attend classes in person are more likely to be focused, motivated, and develop important social skills. therefore, it is important for schools to continue to offer unperson classes for their students.",0,0,5.2770614847165746e-05

"the idea that aliens may have visited or even lived on mars has captured the imagination of people around the world for decades. the discovery of a face like martian mesa in cydonia by nasa's viking 1 spacecraft in 1976 fueled these theories and sparked a lot of interest in the red planet. however, the truth is that the face is just a natural landform, akin to earth's buttes or mesas, as revealed by nasa's mars global surveyor in 1997. there are several claims to support the argument that the face is a natural landform. to start with, the face appears in a location that is known to be an ancient martian ocean boundary. this suggests that it was formed over millions of years through geological processes, similar to how mesas are formed in deserts on earth. secondly, the fact that the mars global surveyor was able to capture high resolution images of the face shows that it is not a hidden or mysterious feature, but rather something that can be seen and examined by scientists. there is also evidence from the article to support these claims. nasa prioritized photographing cydonia with the mars global surveyor in 1997, indicating that the agency was interested in studying the geology of the area, not just searching for signs of life on mars. the images captured by the mars global surveyor revealed the face to be a natural landform, not unlike other mesas in the area. laser altimetry, another scientific tool used to map terrain on mars, confirmed that the face was not a unique or unusual feature but just another mesa in cydonia. in conclusion, the face on mars was not created by aliens but is simply a natural landform. the evidence presented in the article shows that the face was not a hidden or mysterious feature, but a well known geological formation that was studied and examined by nasa. while the idea of aliens visiting mars might be appealing, we need to base our conclusions on evidence and scientific data, not just on what we want to believe.",0,0,0.02520665660799079

"the face on mars refers to a peculiar formation of the planet's terrain that resembles a face. this formation was first discovered by nasa's viking 1 spacecraft in the late 1990s. for many years, scientists and laypeople alike have been fascinated by the face on mars, wondering what it is and what it means. there are many theories regarding the origin of the face on mars. some believe it is simply a feature of the planet's geology, created by the movement of the red planet's ice caps over time. others, however, are convinced that the face is evidence of ancient martian life, either in the form of a massive organism or as a remnant of an extinct martian civilization. despite the many theories, there are still several key questions about the face on mars that have yet to be answered. one of the biggest mysteries is why this formation resembles a face at all. while the face shape has been compared to human faces, it is worth noting that no two faces on mars are alike. the planet's terrain is full of other unusual formations, yet it is only this one that has been deemed to resemble a face. another question that has yet to be answered is why the face on mars is so brightly lit. the mars orbiter laser altimeter has estimated that the face's brightness is about on par with the planet's ice caps. many scientists have speculated that the brightness is due to the presence of organic compounds. if this is the case, it could indicate that the face was a thriving biosphere in the distant past. finally, there is the question of what happened to the face on mars after the viking spacecraft discovered it. many scientists believe that the formation was damaged by the mars rovers in the 2000s, which are thought to have left footprints on the planet's surface. others, however, have suggested that the rovers simply discovered a previously unknown feature of the planet's geology. in conclusion, the face on mars remains a fascinating and mysterious formation, full of questions and speculation. whether it is a result of geological features or evidence of ancient life, the face on mars continues to captivate scientists and laypeople alike. as technology progresses and more information is uncovered, we may finally be able to understand the true nature of this mysterious formation.",0,0,0.0005115502138757365
"to the principal i think that policy number one would be the best option for middle school and high school instead of elementary because first almost all the elementary students don't have cell phones so in middle school it's relatively the same thing, but there is a lot more who have a cell phones. wlus most kids should be mature enough already to have the common sense to turn off their phones in class because that is what our principal does all the students that have phones have to register it into our school before it can be brought to school and at know time can the cell phone be used, and it must be off and concealed. instead, this policy is better in my opinion with the ability to use your cell phone at lunch it will help kids blow off steam and maybe focus better in the later classes provided the cell phone is turned off after lunch which again is common sense. so in my opinion make this new policy happen i like it and i can abide by its rules easily, and it also makes me happy because then i can text or call my friends and family at lunch so i don't have to worry about family and i can check in with friends from other schools besides that a lot of kids in high school have their cell phones out in the halls texting and calling and stuff like that plus with this new policy is obviously going to be noisy in lunch and the halls so easily just make a rule to have all cell phones on vibrate if you're going to be using them simple and easy i think it's a great policy that should really be set in motion for at least all middle and high schools in maryland and all states if those states allow.",1,1,0.9998698233991626
"i most definitely agree with the scientists behind the facial action coding system. by having the ability to read a student's emotions the world of education could make huge strides. by simply altering a lesson to fit a child's personality, the lesson could become more enjoyable and less challenging for the child. dr. huang predicts that, a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or formed. then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor. if dr. huang is in fact right about his technology's potential, children all over the world could become fetter educated. from my own personal experience i know that when the lesson deals with something i am less interested in i become formed, fut if the lesson mentions something i enjoy, then it becomes ten times easier. dr. huang also says that, most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. this is one of the most important lines in the article. by saying this, dr. huang opens up a world of opportunities for his technology. many teachers around the world would agree that their students when talking, communicate more with their emotions than physical words. these teachers would fe able to know how their entire class was feeling as soon as they walked in. this would enhance the teacher's teaching style for the day, and increase the students learning opportunity. dr. huang's final argument is also very important. he says when referring to nonverbal human communications that, computers need to understand that to. dr. huang believes that computers must learn to read the human emotions, and i agree. this generation is becoming more and more about technology, and most schools have converted completely to technology phased schooling. if every school had the ability to use the facial action coding system, the intelligence of this generation and generations to come would continue to grow exponential. the facial action coding system, is a huge new technology that would make huge improvements to classrooms. its ability to recognize emotions would not only benefit students, fut would benefit the teachers of those students. the intelligence of our generation and generations that preceded us will continue to grow with the use of facs.",1,1,0.9902936702704173

"as an 8th grade student, i have been asked to research the pros and cons of allowing phones in classrooms for educational purposes. after conducting thorough research and evaluating the arguments for and against, i strongly believe that students should not have phones in classrooms. one of the main arguments against allowing phones in classrooms is that it can be a distraction. students may dse their phones to scroll through social media, play games, or text their friends instead of paying attention to the lesson. according to a study conducted by the national center for education statistics, students who dse their phones during class time are more likely to have lower grades and lower standardized test scores compared to those who do not aces, 2020 . this is because phones can take away from the learning experience and make it harder for students to focus. another argument against allowing phones in classrooms is that it can lead to cyberbullying and online harassment. students may dse their phones to billy or harass their peers, which can create a toxic learning environment. according to a survey conducted by the pew research center, 59 of teens have experienced online bullying, and 43 have experienced it in the past year pew, 2020 . by allowing phones in classrooms, we are putting students at risk of being bellied or harassed, which can negatively impact their mental health and academic performance. furthermore, allowing phones in classrooms can also lead to a lack of facetoface interaction. students may dse their phones to communicate with their peers instead of engaging in class discussions or asking questions. according to a study conducted by the university of california, los angeles, students who dse their phones during class time are less likely to participate in class discussions and have lower levels of social interaction ucla, 2018 . this can lead to a lack of social skills and a decrease in overall academic performance. in conclusion, while there may be some benefits to allowing phones in classrooms, such as increased access to educational resources and the ability to communicate with peers, the negative impact it can have on student learning outweighs these benefits. by not allowing phones in classrooms, we",0,0,0.000977761069160918

"limiting cars' usage, as bogot did with its day without cars, can have numerous advantages beyond simply reducing car related air pollution. for starters, it can encourage people to use alternative transportation methods like biking, hiking, skating, or public transportation. this can not only help reduce traffic congestion, but also promote a healthier lifestyle, as it encourages people to walk or bike instead of sitting in their cars all day. additionally, as bogot mayor antanas mockus noted, car free days can help reduce stress and promote a more relaxed lifestyle. furthermore, initiatives like day without cars can have significant long term effects beyond simply a one day event. for instance, bogot 's car free campaign has resulted in the construction of over 118 miles of bike paths, which is the most in latin america. this kind of infrastructure can help promote sustainable transportation options for years to come. and as more cities participate in car free days, it can help foster a growing sense of awareness and commitment to reducing our reliance on cars. overall, the benefits of limiting car usage extend beyond just one day a year. by promoting alternative transportation options, reducing air pollution, and fostering a more relaxed lifestyle, car free days can help transform the way we think about transportation and urban living. as more cities around the world participate in car free events, we can look forward to a future with cleaner air, healthier communities, and a more sustainable way of life.",0,0,6.242830149079112e-05

"dear state senator , i am writing to you today to voice my opinion on whether the electoral college should be maintained or a direct popular vote should be used to elect the u.s. president. after careful consideration and research, i firmly believe that the electoral college should remain in place. firstly, the electoral college ensures certainty of outcome in presidential elections. this is because it allocates electors based on state representation in congress, and almost all states use a winner take all approach. this means that the candidate who wins the majority of votes in a state gets all of its electoral votes, ensuring a clear and decisive outcome. secondly, the electoral college requires candidates to have broad, transregional appeal. candidates must appeal to a wide variety of states, rather than just those with the largest populations. this encourages candidates to address the needs and concerns of all americans, not just those in certain regions. thirdly, the electoral college focuses attention on swing states. candidates must work hard to win these states, which are not solidly democratic or republican, in order to secure the election. this encourages more active campaigning and engagement from both candidates and voters in all regions of the country. fourthly, the electoral college balances the influence of large states. it ensures that the needs and concerns of smaller states are heard and addressed, rather than just those of the most populous states. finally, the electoral college avoids the need for run off elections. in a direct popular vote, if no candidate receives a majority of votes, a run off election must be held. this would be time consuming and costly, and may result in even more voter disenfranchisement. while some may argue that the electoral college is undemocratic, i believe that it is a stabilizing factor in the representative democratic process of the united states. it is a system that has been in place for centuries, and has served our country well. in conclusion, i urge you to maintain the electoral college as the method of electing the u.s. president. it ensures certainty of outcome, requires candidates to have broad, transregional appeal, focuses attention on swing states, balances the influence of large states, and avoids the need for run off elections. thank you for your time and consideration. sincerely, your name",0,0,5.417457387419173e-05

"some schools have started to incorporate cell phones into the classroom for educational purposes. while this may seem like a great way to engage students and enhance their learning experience, i believe that students should not be allowed to use their cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. firstly, cell phones can be a major distraction for students. when students are allowed to use their cell phones in class, they are more likely to be distracted by social media, texting, and other non educational activities. this can cause them to miss important information and not fully engage with the material being taught. in addition, students who are constantly using their cell phones in class are likely to have poor grades and struggle to keep up with their coursework. secondly, cell phones can also be a major hindrance to students' learning. when students are allowed to use their cell phones in class, they are not fully engaging with the material being taught. they may be listening to lectures or taking notes, but they are not actively participating in class discussions or asking questions. this can lead to a lack of understanding of the material and can make it difficult for students to apply what they have learned in real world situations. while some argue that cell phones can be a useful resource for students, i believe that they are not necessary for educational purposes. students can find the information they need through other means, such as books, online resources, or asking their teachers for help. in fact, many schools have libraries and other resources available to students that can help them find the information they need. in conclusion, while cell phones may seem like a convenient way to incorporate technology into the classroom, i believe that students should not be allowed to use them for educational purposes. cell phones can be a major distraction and hindrance to students' learning, and there are plenty of other resources available to help them succeed in their coursework.",0,0,0.00014120648113459037
"dear, state senator the voting of the president every four years is one of the most important events of american history. however i feel that it has become unfair and a volatile way of voting. i believe that we the people should rid ourselves of the electoral college and turn to the popular vote instead. too many events concerning the need for this change have been caused by the electoral college. even nixon who was caught up in a electoral vs. popular vote dispute said aboilish the electoral college. . first and foremost the fact that the peolpe do not vote for the president is a worying factor when the presidential election comes around. the people vote on an electoral slate of electors who may or may not actually vote for the president you want perhaps deciding to defy the will of the people from source 2 and vote against their political party. also you dont have the power to decide which candidates will be running so the people who will vote for your president are possibly unrelateable politicians who may be waiting to turn against the political party they belong to. there is the very likely posibility based on the information in source 2 staing that during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states diddnt see the candidates at all, including rhode island and south carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets diddnt get to see a single coampaign add. . personally i dont know how anybody would be able to make the correct descision when electing a elector based on what you may hear about them from a friend a couple states over who may or may not have seen the candidates. although highly unlikely, a tie in the electoral college would mean the unbalancing of power between states. overall the electoral college is unfair and needs to be replaced by the will of the people and not the will of a masked politician.",1,1,0.9987937107622126

"presidential elections have always been decided by electoral votes. the elections today should be voted on using popular votes. all though electoral votes keeps the amount of work tallying up votes down popular votes will give you a more accurate percentage of votes each candidate recieves. initially, when you use popular votes to decide a victor, there will be a more accurate percentage or number of votes per candidate. popular votes are counted by each individual voter. this allows a more accurate voting scale to be used, since there is an exact number of voters. electoral votes are based on a state's population and each region in the state is assigned a democratic elector. this only accounts for the majority of the population's votes, which means some voters' votes are irrevelant if the majority voted for an opposing candidate. additionally, counting popular votes, while time consuming, is worth the effort. popular votes, when used, are to make sure that everybody is accounted for in the poll. more people would probably vote if they knew that their vote actually matters. when popular votes are used it may take a longer time to tally all of those up than it would for electoral votes, it shows exactly how many people are actually voting. this will let the government know how many votes they should expect to see on each poll. in summation, popular votes, though time consuming, are a better way of electing a new president instead of electoral votes. electoral votes are an easier and faster means of counting votes but, popular votes show and acount for everybody that contributes to the poll and or election. using popular votes will most likely make more people want to vote, since they can see the amount of voters instead of the number of regions through out the country.",1,1,0.986384399486438

"the electoral college system in the united states has been a subject of debate since its implementation in the late 18th century. it was designed with the intention of ensuring that every state's interests were represented in the election of the president, as well as to prevent the possibility of a tyranny of the majority. the electoral college consists of 538 electors, with each state having a number of electors equal to the combined total of its u.s. senators two and its representatives in the house of representatives based on its population . the electors are appointed by each state, typically by the state legislature or by the state governor, and they vote to elect the president and vice president. proponents of the electoral college argue that it maintains the balance of power between states and ensures that smaller states still have their voices heard in the process. they also believe that it prevents candidates from focusing solely on densely populated areas, as they need to campaign in a diverse set of states to secure electoral votes. critics of the electoral college argue that it can lead to the election of a candidate who does not win the popular vote. this happened in the 2016 presidential election when hillary clinton received more popular votes but lost due to the electoral college system. they also argue that it gives undue power to a few swing states that have a higher number of electoral votes, which could lead to candidates ignoring the concerns of other states. in conclusion, the electoral college system works in the sense that it fulfills its intended purpose of ensuring representation for each state, regardless of size or population. however, its shortcomings have been highlighted, and many people believe that the electoral college should be reformed or abolished. the debate surrounding the electoral college is ongoing, and it will continue to be a topic of discussion in the united states.",0,0,0.0003575687695480023
"the use of cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes is a fantastic idea because it allows students to save a lot of time in finding information and completing tasks. teachers will not have to worry about collecting books or magazines, as students can easily access information through their phones. additionally, students will find the work more manageable as phones are more practical and easy to use compared to books or magazines. the use of cell phones in the classroom is a good idea because it benefits both students and teachers. students will save a lot of time in finding information for projects, which is a time consuming task. with the phone, students can find information more quickly and have more time to complete other tasks. teachers will also benefit from the use of cell phones in the classroom. they will not have to worry about collecting all the materials that students use to do their work. for example, in some classes, students have to find a lot of information, such as in government, biology, and world history classes. with the use of phones, teachers will not have to collect all the things that students were using, and they will not have to worry about cleaning up the mess. students will complete all their work because if they have a project that requires finding information, they will do it faster on their phones. phones are more practical and easier to use compared to books or magazines that students normally use. the primary reason that students give for not finishing their work is that they do not have sufficient time because finding information in books is hard. in conclusion, the use of cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes is a fantastic idea that will benefit both students and teachers. students will save a lot of time in finding information and completing tasks, and teachers will not have to worry about collecting materials or cleaning up the mess. with the use of cell phones, students will be able to complete their work on time, and teachers will have more time to focus on teaching.",0,0,0.0449520733612165
"the face is just a natural landform on mars. scientists made the conclusion about the face based on facts. also, the camera scientists used was great at capturing the face, and the face is very similiar to landforms we have on earth. these reasons are why the face is a natural landform. the face is a natural landform because scientists made the conclusion based on facts. throughout the article, scientists took various photos of the face. in all of these photos, scientists concluded that it was just a natural landform. also, scientists study mars often, they have never seen any traces of alien artifacts. there are more facts to believe the face was a natural landform than an alien aritifact. another reason to believe the face was just a natural landform is because the camera they used was very good at detailing the face. in paragraph 10, the article states that each pixel spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel from the photo in 1976. this means the photo was a good picture to study off of. also, in paragraph 11, the article says the camera could have captured things like planes, pyramids, or shacks. if there was anything like that on mars, the camera would have seen it. since we did not see anything through the camera, we do not have a reason to believe the face was an alien artifact. lastly, the face is very similar to what we have on earth. in paragraph 12, jim garvin says the face looks a lot like a butte or mesa. he said it reminded him of middle butte in the snake river plain of idaho. we know it is just a natural landform because we know what a natural landform looks like, but we do not know what an alien artifact looks like. we can not make an assumption when we have facts. in conclusion, the face is just a natural landform. we have many reasons to believe this because of reasons like the camera, facts, and similar things we have on earth. there are a lot of facts and reasons connected to the face supporting it just being a natural landform.",1,1,0.9869060043260397

"this piece is about why scientist should explore venus. the author supported his or her claim of exploring venus well. the author provides evidence to counter venus's harsh conditions. the author gives many reasons why venus is a dangerous planet. for example, the author says that there is a thick atmosphere that is 97 percent carbon dioxide, not only that but the clouds are highly corrosive with sulfuric acid. the surface temperature is over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 times that of earth's. the author also mentions that the geology and weather is chaotic as well. the author manages to give some evidence for each of the dangers of venus. he or she states that scientists can hover thirty some miles above the surface to avoid geological and most weather hazards. it is also said that hovering up high will decrease the temperature down to about 170 degrees fahrenheit and the pressure to earth's sea level. this gives the idea that a human survivng on venus is not easy but possible. the author gives that fact that nasa is currently working on electronics that can withstand venus's surface, and the longest it has lasted is three weeks, so scientists can gather artifacts from venus and study them. the author provides evidence in that scientists are currently working to combat venus's harsh conditions. the evidence present shows that it is possible to counter the planet's harsh conditions and also how close the humans are to being able to explore venus.",1,1,0.9964568375650275
"facial coding is cool, but it is not valuable in a school setting. why would one ever need this at their school. students do not go school to get their emotions checked, they go to learn about history stuff or about anything else. also we do not know if this computer will truly work on a human because they only talk about attemping it on a painting not a live physical humans. also how can one produce something so complex that a pc can not even keep up with it. to one it might might be cool, but in reality it is not that interesting for school use. why use a computer? using a computer to find people's emotion is uneccessary because alto mentions the brain does this calculation everyday with even more acurracy and it will help build comunication skills and put oneself on a deeper level of thought. there is a person that this boy likes or has a crush on and he wants to talk to her, but he doesn't know what to say. later he notices that she is obviously down about something, and he walks over to her and says hey, are you alright you look kinda down? this is the skills we need to work on we need to not rely on computersand learn to read emotions. while people agree and disagree with this idea the opposition has some good points. if there is kid that has been mentally abused or is depressed. having this imagery can really help get students to open up and talk about it, so they can prevent what is happening. another thing it can do is help depict the mood of a painting like previously stated in this article by d'alto. also it could help teachers more on understanding their students so they can buils a more positive and stable relationship. by knowing what people are feeling it could effect the mental state of the mind and body and not cause stress. overall the effect to this product would be not having the ability to actually depict how one is feeling without using the coding system which could make human intereaction almost artificial. later on down the road this could be useful, but as it is today it's not the greatest idea for a school atomosphere, especially with the distraction of social media and technology in general.",1,1,0.9994174072490957
"dear senator, after doing some background research on the theme of the electoral college, i have realized that this system is wrong and should be changed. now you ms yaks yourself why?. here are my reasons on why to exterminate the electoral college. and my ideas on what is going to replace it. nhat the electoral college does is basically a chain of votes. meaning someone votes for someone and then that someone votes for another someone. this may seem confusing, and personally i think it is!. nhy vote for a slate of electors when we could vote for the president. i mena is like skipping a step of the sequence a very complex sequence don't you think its easier, faster, better and less confusing to just vote for the president. every single citizen votes for whom they want. that's why i propose an idea. this idea is easier, faster and better... mr ms senator lets apply the election by popular vote system. its less confusing and less biased. for ex. if u want to vote for tim hart for president, you just have to vote simple right now using the other system you have to vote for the group of democratic people that is voting for tim hart. and then hope that they didn't steal your vote, and they voted for another candidate. you see what i'm saying her. the system of popular election vote is way safer than the electoral college. also, this system is more equal than the other, speaking of the problem of small states. ex large states gets more attention form presidential candidates than a small state does 4 big states, p 21 l 10 . this shows that the electoral college system is unequal. now in the other hand with our system, no matter small or large states, everyone will get the same attention. to conclude this essay the election by popular vote is clearly safer, faster, better and more equal than the electoral college, this is why i ask you if you could just think about the idea, and share the word with your collins and people you know thanks",1,1,0.9960197591448384

"technology rapidly advancing and has many benefits. these benefits can be seen anywhere but especially in classrooms, as schools are always looking to innovate in new ways to make their students smarter, more comfortable, and learn more overall in class. one of these technologies is the facial action coding system or f.a.c.s which allows computers to identify human emotions, this technology would be very valuable to students and their learning experience. there is lots of value in adding this to the learning experience. for example a computer could adjust the lesson by seeing the look on your face. it can do this since the f.a.c.s. system can quantify the muscles behind human emotion giving an accurate representation of what the person is feeling. if a student is happy with the lesson the system could be used to shorten this lesson since the student likely already knows it and if the student is confused or disgusted by the lesson the program can continue it till they are satisfied with their skills in it and have learned what is necessary. there are some cons to the f.a.c.s system right now though. first, the f.a.c.s system is expensive and requires a super powerful computer to use. second, a student may be satisfied even when not knowing a lesson. third. the f.a.c.s system could be incorrect in some aspects as it does not have as wide a range of emotions as we feel. however, even though it is flawed these flaws can be fixed. it is likely in the future that the cost of the f.a.c.s system go down as things like telephones and computers have done. it is also very likely that the accuracy of the f.a.c.s system goes up as time goes on things like the cellphone and television we're very primitive concepts at the beginning of their life but have advanced and flourished since then. so the flaws of the f.a.c.s system in schools are minor compared to the benefits. the facial action coding system is truly changing the game when it comes to technology. soon, it could change the education field as well. this could cause a revolution in education make it easier for students to learn and easier for them to excel if done right, which hopefully it will be.",1,1,0.9457870094330482
"working in a group or working alone has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. while some people may prefer to work alone, others may find it more beneficial to work in a group. in this essay, i will discuss the benefits of working together in a group versus working alone, and provide examples to support my argument. working in a group can be very beneficial as it allows for the exchange of ideas and perspectives. when people work together, they can bounce ideas off each other and come up with creative solutions to problems. this can lead to more innovative and effective solutions than if someone were to work alone. for example, in a group project at school, my classmates and i worked together to create a presentation on climate change. we each brought our own unique ideas and perspectives to the project, and through our discussions and collaborations, we were able to create a well rounded and informative presentation. another benefit of working in a group is the opportunity to learn from others. when people work together, they can learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses. this can help to improve their own skills and knowledge, and can also lead to better communication and understanding between team members. for example, in a group project at school, my classmates and i worked together to create a business plan for a fictional company. we each had different areas of expertise, and through our collaborations, we were able to learn from each other and improve our own skills. working alone can also have its benefits, such as increased focus and productivity. when people work alone, they can often be more focused on their task and less distracted by the thoughts and ideas of others. this can lead to increased productivity and efficiency. for example, when i am studying for an exam, i often prefer to work alone in a quiet environment. this allows me to focus on my studies and avoid distractions. in conclusion, working together in a group and working alone both have their own set of benefits. working in a group allows for the exchange of ideas and perspectives, as well as the opportunity to learn from others. working alone can lead to increased focus and productivity. ultimately, the best approach depends on the task at hand and the individual's preferences.",0,0,3.221454938360099e-05

"summer projects in schools can be beneficial if done right. while teacher designed projects ensure coverage of important topics, student designed projects better motivate learning. a balanced approach allows the benefits of both while mitigating the downsides. teacher designed projects guarantee that students learn or review material deemed necessary by their instructors. this helps ensure students don't fall behind over the summer months. however, assigning the same project to all students risks disengaging those who aren't interested. it also limits creative exploration of topics that inspire personal curiosity. student designed projects address these issues. by choosing their own topics, students feel a sense of ownership over their work. this intrinsic motivation enhances learning and problem solving. students are free to research areas they find engaging, leading to deeper understanding. the independence fosters time management skills. an ideal model gives students guidance in designing meaningful projects, with teacher approval. teachers could provide a list of approved topics or learning objectives for students to address. one on one discussions help align student interests with educational goals. teachers then review initial proposals and provide feedback to ensure rigor. regular check ins allow adaptation if students encounter difficulties independently researching their topics. students stay accountable while having flexibility. designing projects together respects student voice and autonomy within a supportive structure. in conclusion, summer projects are most effective with a balanced, collaborative approach between student choice and teacher guidance. this engages student motivation while addressing curriculum aims. it prepares students for independent work and helps preventsummer learning loss, in a way that feels relevant to their lives outside of school.",0,0,0.001109390766592052

"phones driving i feel like drivers should not be able to use cellular devices in any capacity while operating a vehicle. i strongly feel this way because it's very dangerous. texting and driving has been the main cause for most car accidents. car accidents that can potentially lead to death or a serious injury. not only are people putting their life at risk, but they're putting others life at risk as well. texting can wait and should never be done while driving. operating a cellular device while driving a vehicle is dangerous in many ways. when your vehicle is traveling at 35 mph that means you are moving at 16 meters per second. so, in those few moments your eyes were on your cellular device instead of the road. this means you have moved far enough to not see a school bus, a kid playing, or a vehicle braking in front of you. just reaching for your phone could be deadly as well. texting and driving has caused 1.6 million crashes a year. 390,000 injuries also occur each year due to texting and driving. also 1 out every 4 car crashes occur due to texting and driving. responding to a text while driving can distract a driver for around 5 seconds. at 50 mph this is enough time to travel the distance of a football field. honestly, i've seen so many people texting while driving while i was a passenger. i didn't feel safe at all. it's almost like feeling like i'm in the car with a drunk driver. seeing people drive reckless makes me wonder what's going to happen. i think that driving while texting should be banned completely. so basically, cellular devices and cars are like oil and water. they don't mix well at all. if you take cellular device use while in cars out of the picture, this will benefit the world in many ways. there will be less car crashes, injuries, and deaths caused by distractions. its simple cellular devices should not be used while operating a vehicle for any reason unless there is a life or death emergency. taking them away from those operating cars or even bikes could save lives.",1,1,0.99454420050797
"the importance of individuality and its role in achieving great accomplishments individuality is a unique quality that sets each person apart from the rest. it is the essence of what makes us human, and it is what allows us to achieve great accomplishments in life. throughout history, there have been countless examples of individuals who have used their individuality to make a difference in the world. in this essay, i will explore the importance of individuality and how it leads to the greatest achievements. firstly, individuality allows us to think outside the box and come up with innovative ideas. when we are not constrained by the expectations of others, we are free to explore our own thoughts and ideas. this is what allows us to come up with new and unique solutions to problems. for example, albert einstein was a prime example of individuality. he was not afraid to challenge the status quo and came up with groundbreaking theories that revolutionized the field of physics. secondly, individuality allows us to pursue our passions and interests. when we are true to ourselves and follow our own path, we are more likely to find fulfillment and happiness in life. this is because we are able to focus on what truly matters to us, rather than trying to fit into someone else's mold. for instance, steve jobs was known for his individuality and his relentless pursuit of innovation. he was able to create products that were not only functional, but also beautiful and unique. lastly, individuality allows us to overcome obstacles and challenges. when we are faced with adversity, our individuality allows us to find unique solutions and approaches to overcome the obstacle. this is because we are able to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions that others may not have considered. for example, elon musk has faced numerous challenges in his career, but his individuality and determination have allowed him to overcome them and achieve great success. in conclusion, individuality is a crucial aspect of achieving great accomplishments in life. it allows us to think outside the box, pursue our passions, and overcome obstacles. throughout history, there have been countless examples of individuals who have used their individuality to make a difference in the world. by embracing our own unique qualities and approaches, we can achieve great success and make a positive impact on the world around us.",0,0,4.443909402482571e-06

"while distance learning provides flexibility, attending traditional classes at school provides important social and learning benefits that better serve students. there are some advantages to allowing students the option to attend classes from home via online platforms. it allows for flexibility that can help those with health issues, transportation difficulties, or family obligations. students would not need to worry about commutes or finding childcare. they could potentially balance school with other responsibilities more easily. however, the traditional classroom setting provides invaluable social experiences and supports that are difficult to replicate through distance learning alone. in school, students have daily interaction with teachers and peers that aids their social and emotional development. they learn collaboration, teamwork, and communication by working in groups. peer interaction helps students stay focused, motivated, and accountable in their studies. many students thrive on the structure, routine and deadlines of attending classes at set times each day. the classroom is also a controlled learning environment. it can be challenging for students to avoid distractions and stay disciplined while learning from home, where there are many potential distractions like phones, television and chores. learning from a teacher in person also allows for a more active and engaging learning experience versus online alone. students benefit from being able to directly ask questions, participate in hands on activities and receive immediate feedback, which aids their understanding and problem solving skills. while distance learning offers certain advantages of flexibility, for most students, the social and learning benefits of attending traditional classes at their school outweigh those benefits. students would be better served by attending in person unless health or family needs require otherwise. an ideal approach would be to offer distance learning as an alternative option only on a case by case basis. overall, the traditional classroom experience is most developmentally appropriate and supportive for students.",0,0,4.473713765773878e-05
"high school can be a stressful time for anyone, but especially for teens trying to figure out what they want to do with the rest of their lives. any people believe that it is a good idea for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school, but this expectation is unrealistic and can sometimes backfire. identifying a career by the time students enter high school puts an immense amount of pressure on them. any teens are required to decide what career path they want to take at a time when they can barely decide what to have for lunch or what to wear. without the proper guidance and resources, too many teens are set up for disappointment and failure if they choose the wrong career path. in addition to the stress and pressure of having to decide on a career at a young age, there is the potential for students to limit themselves when making career decisions. too many teens opt for the safer, more traditional career options such as engineering or law, while missing out on exciting and potentially more rewarding career paths such as art, music, or other creative fields. when teens limit themselves to one career chosen too early, they miss out on the exploration and excitement of figuring out what their true passions are and can find themselves feeling stuck in a job they re not passionate about. overall, it is not a good idea for students to identify a career before entering high school. the amount of pressure teens are put under to choose a career path is tremendous, and can lead to disappointment and stress later on. in addition, when teens limit themselves to a single career path at such a young age, they are unable to explore their passions and may feel like they are stuck in a job they don t want. therefore, it is important that teens explore their interests and don t feel forced to commit to a career too early.",0,0,0.0003034519654082996

"introduction hey there! so you think that the face on mars is like, totally created by aliens? like, come on! that's so cool! but like, actually, it's not. it's just a natural landform. yeah, i know, it looks all fancy and stuff, but trust me, it's not as exciting as it seems. body first, like, let's talk about how the face was formed. according to the article, it was created by natural geological processes, like erosion and weathering. the article says that the face is actually a mesa which is like, a flat topped hill, and it was formed by the wind and water over millions of years. that's not something that aliens would do, right? i mean, why would they bother making a face on a planet that's like, billions of miles away? it doesn't make sense! and secondly, like, the face is not even that special. the article says that there are like, lots of other faces on mars, but they're not as well known as the one we're talking about. so, like, why would aliens only make one face? wouldn't they want to make like, a whole army of faces or something? and also, the face is not even that detailed. it's just like, a few lines and curves. if aliens were going to make a face, they would make it way more detailed and fancy, right? conclusion so yeah, like, in conclusion, the face on mars is not created by aliens. it's just a natural landform that was formed by geological processes. it's not that special, and it doesn't make sense that aliens would make it. so, like, next time you look up at the sky and see mars, remember, it's not a face made by aliens, it's just a rock!",0,0,0.011975691158712094
"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the electoral college. as you know, the electoral college is a system in which each state is allocated a number of electors equal to the number of senators and representatives it has in congress. the candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives all of that state's electoral votes, except in maine and nebraska, which award their electoral votes by congressional district. this system has led to several instances in which the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election, most recently in 2016. there are many reasons why i believe the electoral college is an outdated and undemocratic system. first, it gives disproportionate power to a small number of states. the four most populous states california, texas, florida, and new york account for a combined 109 electoral votes, more than a quarter of the total. this means that a candidate who can win the popular vote in these four states is almost guaranteed to win the presidency, even if they lose the popular vote in the rest of the country. second, the electoral college encourages candidates to focus on a small number of swing states where the outcome of the election is uncertain. this means that candidates often ignore the needs of voters in states where they are already assured of victory or defeat. this is particularly harmful to voters in small states, who have little to no say in the outcome of the election. third, the electoral college can lead to minority rule. in 2016, donald trump won the presidency despite losing the popular vote by nearly three million votes. this was possible because trump won the electoral votes of a few key states, even though he lost the popular vote in those states. this means that a candidate can win the presidency with the support of a minority of the country's voters. i believe that the electoral college is an undemocratic and unfair system that should be abolished. i urge you to support legislation that would end the electoral college and elect the president by popular vote. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.0014889510278945914

"in today's world, individuals have their own opinions and make their own decisions. however, this has led to a significant shift in the way people approach decision making. people are now more intelligent and make wise decisions on a daily basis. however, they often take risks without consulting experts or authorities. it is crucial for individuals to seek guidance from experts and authorities when making significant decisions. this will make it easier for them to choose the best options, as they will have someone who already knows about it. people often make wrong decisions when they make decisions on their own. celebrities, for example, have personal managers who make thoughtful decisions for them to keep them on track with their careers. if celebrities were to make their own decisions, many of them would likely fail in their careers. the decisions people make should be thoughtful and well informed. seeking guidance from experts is essential to ensure that the decisions made are the best possible ones. for instance, christopher from into the wild is a prime example of the dangers of not seeking advice. he went into the wilderness of alaska alone without any guidance or preparation, which ultimately led to his death. if he had sought advice from experts, he would have had a better chance of survival. people who seek advice from experts and authorities are more likely to have a successful life. while there are some individuals who have achieved success in their careers by making their own decisions, most people need guidance from experts to keep them on track. seeking advice from experts is more reliable than making decisions on one's own, as it reduces the likelihood of making wrong decisions. in conclusion, seeking guidance from experts and authorities is crucial when making significant decisions. it ensures that the decisions made are well informed and thoughtful, reducing the likelihood of making wrong decisions. people who seek advice are more likely to have a successful life and career, while those who make decisions on their own are more likely to fail.",0,0,0.06758519147462487

"i believe that my school should not adopt the model of extending the school day to conserve energy and resources by two hours. while some businesses have adopted this approach, it is not a feasible solution for schools. the government needs to be involved in this decision and consider the potential consequences of implementing it. firstly, extending the school day by two hours would be a difficult choice to made, as it would require families to adjust their schedules and routines. this would be especially challenging for families with young children, who may have extracurricular activities or other commitments outside of school. parents would have to find ways to accommodate these activities while also ensuring that their children have the necessary time to complete homework and other school assignments. secondly, the benefits of extending the school day to conserve energy and resources may not be as significant as some proponents believe. while it may be possible to reduce energy consumption and resource usage, it is not clear that this would have a meaningful impact on the environment or the school's bottom line. furthermore, the cost of implementing this plan could be prohibitive for families, who may not have the financial resources to made the necessary adjustments. finally, there are other ways to conserve energy and resources that may be more effective for schools. for example, schools could implement energy efficient technologies, such as led lighting and solar panels, to reduce their energy consumption. they could also encourage students to conserve water and other resources by implementing water saving measures, such as low flow fixtures and rainwater harvesting systems. in conclusion, while the idea of extending the school day to conserve energy and resources may seem life a good plan, it is not the best solution for schools. there are other ways to conserve energy and resources that may be more effective, and the government needs to carefully consider the potential consequences of making any decisions. ultimately, the best course of action for schools is to prioritize the needs of their students and work to find solutions that are both sustainable and equitable.",0,0,2.0651933935243268e-05
"there are zany reasons why it is better to have broad knowledge of zany academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. one reason is that it allows people to think more critically and creatively. when people are specialists in one area, they tend to think within the boundaries of that area. but when people have a broad knowledge of zany subjects, they are able to think more critically and creatively because they are not limited to one way of thinking. another reason why it is better to have broad knowledge of zany academic subjects is that it helps people to become more well rounded individuals. when people specialize in one area, they often lose sight of the big picture. but when people have a broad knowledge of zany subjects, they are able to see the world from different perspectives, which makes the more well rounded individuals. finally, another reason why it is better to have broad knowledge of zany academic subjects is that it helps people to be more successful in life. when people specialize in one area, they often become so focused on that area that they do not have time to develop other skills. but when people have a broad knowledge of zany subjects, they are able to develop a variety of skills, which makes the more successful in life.",0,0,0.00024092855168300183

"dear principal, i hope this letter finds you well. i wanted to share my thoughts on the idea of requiring all students to perform community service. i believe that community service is an important aspect of personal development and civic responsibility. by participating in community service, students can learn valuable skills, such as teamwork, communication, and problem solving, while also giving back to their community. many of my friends who participate in community service have shared their positive experiences with me. for example, those who tutor elementary school children have told me how rewarding it is to see their students progress and learn new things. similarly, those who clean up litter have expressed a sense of pride in keeping their community clean and beautiful. moreover, community service can help students develop a sense of empathy and understanding for others. by working with people from different backgrounds and experiences, students can broaden their perspectives and gain a deeper appreciation for the diversity of their community. however, i also understand that some of my friends may feel that community service takes too much time away from their other responsibilities or interests. it's important to note that not everyone may have the same level of passion or commitment to community service, and that's okay. in my opinion, requiring all students to perform community service could be beneficial, but it's important to consider a few factors. firstly, the type of community service should be flexible and allow students to choose an activity that aligns with their interests and availability. secondly, the amount of time required for community service should be reasonable and not interfere with students' academic or extracurricular activities. in conclusion, i believe that community service is an valuable experience for students, but it's important to consider the individual needs and interests of each student. by offering flexible and reasonable community service opportunities, students can develop important skills, build empathy, and give back to their community, all while maintaining a healthy balance between their personal and academic responsibilities. thank you for considering my thoughts on this matter. sincerely, your name",0,0,2.4150939428301135e-05
"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united state by popular vote. i believe that this change would be more democratic and would ensure that the president ij elected by the majority of the people. the electoral college ij a system that was created in the 18th century to ensure that the smaller state had a voice in the election of the president. however, this system ij no longer necessary. today, we have a much more efficient way to count vote, and there ij no reason why the president should not be elected by the majority of the people. there are several argument in favor of abolishing the electoral college. first, it ij undemocratic. in the last two presidential election, the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election. this ij because the electoral college given more power to smaller state. in 2000, george w. bush won the election despite losing the popular vote to hl gore by 543,895 vote. in 2016, donald trump won the election despite losing the popular vote to hillary clinton by nearly 3 million vote. second, the electoral college encourage candidate to focus on a small number of wing state. there are state where the outcome of the election ij uncertain. candidate spend a lot of time and money campaigning in there state, while ignoring the need of the voters in other state. this ij not only unfair, but it also prevent candidate from addressing the issue that matter to the majority of american. third, the electoral college ij susceptible to fraud. in the 2016 election, there were allegations of voter suppression and voter fraud in a number of state. there allegations have not been proven, but they raise concerns about the integrity of the electoral college system. i believe that the best way to ensure that the president ij elected by the majority of the people ij to abolish the electoral college and elect the president by popular vote. this would be a more democratic and fair system, and it would ensure that the president represent the interest of all american. i urge you to support a constitutional amendment to abolish the electoral college and elect the president by popular vote. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.017072351106601595

"schools partnering with companies is a concept that has been gaining popularity in recent years. some argue that these partnerships can be beneficial for students, while others believe that they may not be taken seriously and may not lead to any tangible results. however, i believe that schools partnering with companies can be a great idea, especially for students who are unsure about their career path. one of the main benefits of these partnerships is that they can help students make informed decisions about their future. by working with companies, students can gain a better understanding of the skills and qualifications that are required for different careers. this can help them to choose a career path that they are passionate about and that will lead to a fulfilling and successful life. another benefit of these partnerships is that they can provide students with valuable work experience. many companies offer internships or apprenticeships to students, which can give them a chance to gain hands on experience in their field of interest. this can be especially beneficial for students who are still in high school or college, as it can help them to stand out to potential employers when they graduate. in addition to these benefits, schools partnering with companies can also provide students with access to valuable resources and networking opportunities. many companies have resources that they can share with students, such as mentorship programs or access to industry experts. these resources can be invaluable for students who are looking to gain a better understanding of their field and who are looking to make connections in the industry. of course, there are also some potential drawbacks to these partnerships. some students may not take them seriously and may not put in the effort required to make the most of the opportunities that are available to them. additionally, some students may feel pressure to choose a career path that is popular or lucrative, rather than one that they are truly passionate about. overall, i believe that schools partnering with companies can be a great idea, especially for students who are unsure about their career path. by providing students with valuable work experience, access to resources and networking opportunities, and the opportunity to make informed decisions about their future, these partnerships can help students to achieve their full potential and to lead fulfilling and successful lives.",0,0,5.503975557516635e-07

"the prevalence of obesity is an increasingly pressing issue for many countries. beyond its physical health implications, significant research has been conducted to examine the effects of obesity on other aspects of our lives, such as food choices in schools. while pizza and hamburgers are staples in many school cafeterias, these high calorie, processed foods can lead to poor nutrition and long term health problems. fortunately, there are a variety of healthy food options available for schools to serve as healthier alternatives. for example, fruits, vegetables, vegan proteins, and whole grains can provide a more nutritious and diverse range of food items. a person's view of food can also be deeply intertwined with their culture. it can be complex bound by tradition and formed by spiritual beliefs and can help to provide a sense of identity and community. in some cases, students may even experience opposition to healthy lunch options if the food largely does not reflect their cultural habits. therefore, schools must be mindful of their students' backgrounds and ensure that school lunch options can still cater to their needs. ultimately, childhood obesity continues to be a prevalent public health problem, and unhealthy food choices in school can put students at higher risk. to address this, schools can implement healthier lunch options to reduce the risk of obesity related diseases. while the upfront costs of switching to healthier options may be higher, long term returns could have benefits for both current and future generations. these potential benefits could include lowered healthcare costs, reduced rates of chronic diseases, and improved long term cognitive and physical development.",0,0,1.5779231720933597e-08

"dear mr. senator, i have decided to express my opinion to you about the electoral college process for electing the president of the united states. this process should be abolished as soon as possible for it is corrosive to the american peoples opinion. we should instead switch to a popular vote by eligible american citizens to decide presidency. now some fellows might argue that the electoral college is favored by the people. when in fact, as bradford plume points out in paragraph 9, 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now . some people may also say that the electoral college encourages the president to visit all states, when in fact smaller states still are not treated the same as states with more electoral votes. a president would rather spend their time investing and giving information to a state such as california who have 55 electoral votes, who feel more inclined to think about their decision due to their involvement, rather than a state with 3 electoral votes who don't invest as much thought into their votes. in grade school we are taught that popular votes most accurately represent what a specific population wants, way don't we use it in the real world? if your principle wanted to figure out what color the students wanted their yearbooks, sve would not elect people to decide for each class! in the bus and gore election, bus received fewer votes by the american people but won presidency because ve acquired more electoral votes than gore. that means that more american people wanted gore, but the fate was chosen by 271 people, who selected bus as the winner! the electoral college also increases the risk of a tie and if one occurred, the election would be disrupted by the orderly process of which we would have to take to decide the president. in 1968, a change of votes from just 41,971 people would have tied the electoral votes due to the even number of 538 electors. the overall idea i'm trying to express is that the electoral college is a poor way to show peoples opinion, and much rather focuses on that of 270 individuals who in the end, decide the president of the united states. i vote you can see my points and i long for the day when the president is decided by the people.",1,1,0.9967494899738023

"venus, the second planet from the sun, is often referred to as earth's sister planet due to their similar size and proximity to each other. although it has many striking similarities to earth, venus also possesses unique characteristics that make it an intriguing subject for astronomical exploration. one of venus' most notable features is its dense atmosphere. the planet's thick atmosphere is comprised primarily of carbon dioxide, making it the most atmospheric planet in our solar system. this atmosphere traps heat, causing the planet's surface temperature to soar up to a scorching 864 degrees fahrenheit 462 degrees celsius . this extreme temperature makes exploration of the surface challenging, and as a result, most of our understanding about venus comes from studying it from space. one of the main challenges in studying venus is the thick clouds that cover its surface. the clouds are made up of sulfuric acid droplets and consist mostly of sulfuric acid and water vapor. these clouds reflect over 85 of the sunlight, making it difficult for scientists to peer through them and study the surface directly. however, using radar techniques, researchers have been able to map the surface of venus, revealing a variety of geological features, such as volcanoes, mountains, and canyons. in addition to studying the geological features and atmosphere of venus, scientists are also interested in its potential for supporting life. while the extreme temperature and acidic environment make it difficult to believe that life could exist on venus's surface, some research suggests that microorganisms might be able to survive in the planet's atmosphere, particularly in the clouds. one of the primary goals of future missions to venus is to gather more data on its atmosphere, surface, and potential for supporting life. this could include sending probes to analyze the atmosphere, as well as landers to study the surface conditions and collect samples. additionally, researchers hope to better understand the planet's geological processes, such as its volcanism and tectonic activity, which may provide insight into the formation and evolution of our solar system. in conclusion, venus is a fascinating planet with unique features and characteristics that continue to captivate and challenge scientists. through further exploration, we can learn more about its atmosphere, geology, and potential for supporting life, ultimately expanding our understanding of the solar system and the universe beyond earth.",0,0,0.00019612931040009245

"the work ethic of successful athletes is a topic that has been widely discussed in the sports world. many people believe that the key to achieving success is through hard work and dedication. in this essay, i will explore the work ethic of some of the world's greatest athletes, including larry bird, michael jordan, lebron james, and walter canton, and analyze how it has contributed to their success. larry bird, a former basketball player for the boston celtics, is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time. bird was known for his incredible work ethic and dedication to the game. he spent countless hours practicing and perfecting his skills, often late into the night. bird's hard work and dedication paid off, as he won five nba championships and was named mic of the league three times. michael jordan, another basketball legend, also had a strong work ethic. jordan was known for his intense focus and dedication to the game. he spent countless hours practicing and perfecting his skills, often in the gym late into the night. jordan's hard work and dedication paid off, as he won six nba championships and was named mic of the league five times. lebron james, a current basketball player for the los angeles lakers, also has a strong work ethic. james is known for his intense focus and dedication to the game. he spends countless hours practicing and perfecting his skills, often in the gym late into the night. james' hard work and dedication have paid off, as he has won four nba championships and has been named mic of the league four times. walter canton, a former football player for the chicago bears, also had a strong work ethic. canton was known for his intense focus and dedication to the game. he spent countless hours practicing and perfecting his skills, often in the gym late into the night. canton's hard work and dedication paid off, as he won two super bowl championships and was named mic of the league once. when comparing the successes of these athletes to someone who is idle or expects things to come to them, it is clear that hard work and dedication are essential for achieving success. those who are idle or expect things to come to them are unlikely to achieve the level of success that these athletes have",0,0,1.419714360891832e-05
"not using phones in a vehicle crashes, getting pulled over, and not paying attention to the road nobody likes those things, well, most of it comes from cellphones. operating cellphones on the road is not good for you. crashes are one of the main causes of death today. the zebra states that nearly nine people die and 1,000 are injured from car accidents daily where one is distracted by a phone. this implies that most accidents are caused by someone operating cellphones on the road, which shows you how much people stay on their phone in the car and why it is not good for you. in summary of this paragraph driving while on the phone is not good for you. getting pulled over by the cops because of being on your phone while driving happens a lot. while people are in real situations you are getting pulled over by a cop because of a cellphone. the seattle times said that individuals are getting fined 136 for a first ticket and 234 for additional tickets. this shows that if you get pulled over for being on your phone you will be fined for it. in other words it is another example why not to be on your phone while driving. not paying attention to the road is mainly caused by a cellphone. most people when on phones in a car are not paying attention to the road which means they could hit someone or something, hit another car, or run off the road. on wikipedia they say that drivers are distracted, decreasing the drivers' awareness on the road. this confirms that driving and using a phone causes people to not pay attention to the road. therefore, operating cellphones on the road is not good for you. in conclusion to this essay, i explain how driving and operating a phone is not good for you. you could also help by turning off or silencing your phone when you enter the car and drive safely. it could lead to fewer crashes, fewer tickets, and a safer drive.",1,1,0.9999322831921631

"dear state senator, after much research, i have decided that the electoral college should not be kept. it is not completley fair, because the citizens think they're voting for their prefered candidate when really, they're voting for that candidate's electors. that means that if a candidate wins the votes of the citizens, he might not win the electoral college votes. this also means that he was not the president that the u.s. citizens wanted, but what the electoral voters wanted. in the article the indefensible electoral college they ask the question, can voters sometimes controll whom their electors vote for? and they answer, not always. this proves that the electoral college is not fair. also, the electoral college shouldn't be kept because some electors will, refuse to vote for their party's candidate and cast a vote for whomever they please, says the indifensible electoral college . over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. says the indefensible electoral college. that is more than half of the united states population, therefore we should get rid of it. i believe that we should abolish it along with that 60 percent, thatway when voting, it will be much more fair. also, it will make choosing the president of the u.s. up to the people. some may think that keeping the electoral college is good because, if there is a tie in the election, the electoral college can break it with their votes. although this does help, it has only happened once, therefore proving to not be needed. other reasons are because it gives certainty of an outcome, helps big states, and avoids run off elections, but are also not that important. in conclusion i, along with 60 percent of the u.s. populaton, believe that the electoral college should not be kept due to its unfairness. proper name",1,1,0.998665293312888

i think we should ban single use plastics. they are bad for the earth and us. they pollute our oceans and water ways. animals eat them and get sick or die. we cant reuse them so we just throw them away. that means they go to the dump or in the wild. we cant just keep using plastic bottles and straws and bags when we can use other things like metal and paper and cloth. plastic takes a long time to break down and it never really goes away. it just breaks into smaller and smaller pieces that animals can eat or we can breathe in. we are already seeing the effects of plastic pollution. there are huge islands of plastic in the ocean. fish are dying from eating plastic. we are eating fish that have eaten plastic. its not good for us. we need to use things that we can reuse and recycle. we should use metal or glass bottles instead of plastic. we can use paper straws or straws made from plants. we can use cloth bags instead of plastic bags. we can also just carry things ourselves instead of using bags. banning single use plastics might be hard but it's important. we have to do it to save the earth and ourselves. other places have banned plastic bags and straws and it has helped a lot. we can do it too. we can start by banning plastic bags and straws and then move on to other things like bottles and cups. people might say that its hard to change but we have to try. we have to do it for the earth and our future. we can't just keep using plastic and pretend there is no problem. we have to take action. we can do it! i hope you agree with me that we should ban single use plastics. let's make a change and help the earth and ourselves.,0,0,0.24149367545999104

"when faced with an important decision, it is wise to seek advice from multiple people rather than just one. getting different perspectives allows you to consider options you may not have thought of otherwise. it also helps identify potential blind spots or biases in your own thinking. people often view situations through their own lens based on their background and experiences. while a friend or family member may give thoughtful advice, their viewpoint is limited. discussing a decision with others brings additional insights to light. for example, when choosing classes for next semester, a student could talk to peers already in certain programs, current teachers, and school advisors. each offers a unique angle peers know the workload, teachers understand the curriculum, and advisors ensure prerequisites are met. considering these varied perspectives results in a class schedule better tailored for the student's goals and abilities. additionally, multiple opinions serve as a check against faulty or incomplete advice from a single source. even trusted advisors can occasionally overlook important factors or steer someone wrong unintentionally. however, common themes or red flags that emerge across several discussions increase confidence that problem areas or poor alternatives have been identified. for instance, if three friends warn that a new business idea won't attract enough customers, but one enthusiastically endorses it, further market research would be prudent before investing time and money. most importantly, seeking multiple viewpoints prevents premature closure on a decision before all aspects are fully vetted. major choices in life rarely have just one right answer, and delaying a conclusion allows additional viewpoints to be weighed carefully. the more perspectives explored, the more informed the eventual choice will be. teflecting on diverse advice minimizes regret down the road. in summary, discussing important decisions with several trusted individuals provides a well rounded analysis to guide wise choices. the varied lenses of family, friends and experts surface new factors to consider, ensuring no stone is left unturned in determining the best path forward. in the end, a choice informed by multiple opinions will stand the test of time far better than one based on a single source of counsel.",0,0,0.0008464788519553379

"i disagree with the school board's decision to increase the school hours. while it may seem like a good idea to give students more time to learn and complete their school work, the reality is that it will only create more problems for students and teachers. firstly, students already have a lot of responsibilities outside of school, such as homework, after school activities, and family obligations. adding more time to the school day will only make it harder for students to balance these responsibilities and still make time for their school work. this could lead to students falling behind in their studies and struggling to keep up with their coursework. secondly, teachers already have a lot of work to do, including lesson planning, grading assignments, and preparing for exams. adding more time to the school day will only make it harder for teachers to manage their workload and still provide their students with the support and guidance they need. this could lead to teachers becoming overwhelmed and burnt out, which could have a negative impact on the quality of education students receive. finally, students already have a lot of pressure to perform well in school. adding more time to the school day will only make it harder for students to manage their stress and anxiety, which could lead to mental health issues and other negative outcomes. this could also lead to students becoming disengaged from their studies and not taking their education seriously. in conclusion, while it may seem like a good idea to give students more time to learn and complete their school work, the reality is that it will only create more problems for students and teachers. the school board should instead focus on finding ways to support students and teachers in managing their workload and balancing their responsibilities, rather than simply increasing the school day.",0,0,7.6110605289160295e-06
"in recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. this is due to a number of factors, including the environmental impact of cars, the cost of car ownership, and the health risks associated with driving. one of the main reasons to limit car usage is its impact on the environment. cars are a major source of air pollution, which can contribute to climate change. they also produce noise pollution, which can be harmful to human health. in addition, car ownership can be expensive. the cost of a car, including the purchase price, insurance, and maintenance, can be a major financial burden for many people. the cost of gas can also be a significant expense, especially in areas with high gas prices. finally, driving can be dangerous. car accidents are a leading cause of death in the united states. they can also cause serious injuries, such as paralysis and brain damage. there are a number of ways to limit car usage. one option is to walk, bike, or take public transportation instead of driving. another option is to carpool or use a ride sharing service. there are also a number of new technologies that can help to reduce car usage, such as self driving cars and car sharing apps. limiting car usage can have a number of benefits. it can help to reduce air pollution, noise pollution, and traffic congestion. it can also save money and improve public health. in addition, it can make cities more livable and sustainable. if you are interested in limiting car usage, there are a number of things you can do. you can walk, bike, or take public transportation instead of driving. you can carpool or use a ride sharing service. you can also support policies that promote sustainable transportation, such as building more bike lanes and public transportation. limiting car usage is a good way to protect the environment, save money, and improve your health. it is also a good way to make your community more livable and sustainable.",0,0,6.137835397225805e-06

"i like this idea a lot. it would be a good way for students to make new friends and find an activity that they enjoy. some students might not like it because it would take time away from doing other things. even though kids should already be doing activities or sports. a lot of kids will just sit around and watch netflix after school. this will give them a chance to find something they like to do that is more active. i think that parents would be happy that there child is getting more involved and having fun. some people struggle to pay for things like this. so if anyone could give a little extra money for those kids then the teams would be bigger and better. the principle could even make the activities cost little to nothing so that every student could be doing something. if a student isn't participating in a sport then the cost might go up or down, it depends on what they decide. this could help them in the future like when college's start looking for students. they want students who get involved with things at school and who try there best. so if the students don't participate in anything then there is a slimmer chance of getting into a good school. once you graduate and start looking for college's it would be harder to find one if your don't participate in activities.",1,1,0.9990277752287551
"the promises and perils of driverless cars the advent of driverless cars presents both exciting promises as well as challenging perils. according to the article driverless cars are coming, these autonomous vehicles could potentially reduce accidents caused by human error, freeing up time previously spent driving, and providing mobility for those unable to drive themselves. however, their widespread adoption also raises issues regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and the loss of an integral human activity. upon considering both sides, i believe the development of driverless cars should continue, though certain precautions must be taken to maximize benefits and mitigate risks. one benefit highlighted is that removing the human driver could eliminate over 90 of road accidents. as the article notes, human error is a leading cause of crashes, as we can be distracted, drunk, or tired. driverless cars guided by sensors and computers would face none of these issues and could potentially react faster than humans in unsafe situations. this safety aspect could save thousands of lives annually. proponents also argue that driverless cars could offer independence to the elderly and disabled who cannot currently drive. being chauffeured about by an autonomous vehicle could improve their quality of life. however, some downsides exist. without human judgement behind the wheel, will these vehicles be able to make split second decisions in truly novel situations? additionally, as we become more reliant on advanced technology, it introduces vulnerabilities to cyberattacks that do not exist with human driven cars. hackers could potentially gain control and put passengers at risk. there are also concerns about tech companies collecting vast amounts of private data on customers through these always online vehicles. in conclusion, while driverless cars certainly present opportunities to curb accidents and expand access to transportation, their development must include robust safety and security measures to address valid qualms. with proper testing, oversight and privacy legislation, this technology could deliver benefits to society without compromising individual rights or introducing new harms. on balance, continuing research but managing risks intelligently is the best approach to realize driverless cars' promise of saving lives while avoiding reckless disadvantages. careful progress, not abstention, is warranted.",0,0,0.01499629815208773
"thats incorrect! sara shouted to her colligue. theorys are very unbelieveable myths, especially one with aliens. many believe research to be true, but others still believe in theorys. research is not always correct, but it can be proven correct after trial and error. the following agrument is concluding whether to believe theory or research is most truthful in the scenario of the face on mars. theory is false in many ways. it is based on an assumption or a belief that something irrelivant has happened. for example, believing in aliens or the big bang theory is quite inaccurate. we have no proof of their existance or records of their happenings. some believe the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars. this was proved wrong by nasa scientist michael malin when he flew over cydonia for the first time ... his mars orbiter camera moc team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos. malins major accomplishment had thousands of anxious web surfers waiting when the image first appeared on a jpl web site, revealing... a natural landform. this spread news to the people that the research is in fact correct. the face on mars was not an alien monument because it is a natural landform. theorists still refused to believe this as they keep their hopes up to one day see alien forms of life. although the face on mars was proven not to be an alien monument, it does have to be specified to the public of an assumption on what they believe the formation might possibly be. jim garvin, chief scientist for nasa's mars exploration program, concluded that it is a martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. yes, this is a type of theory, but it is a relevant theory based on a previous discovery of events. the previous statements prove that research is the most truthful way to belive in the scenario of the face on mars. scientists michael malin and jim garvin proved that the what was believed to be alien monument, was actually a landform that is common around the american west. that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. in conclusion, the face on earth is proven by research that it is not an alien monument, but an american west resembled mesa.",1,1,0.982046869284069
"the face on mars is a fascinating topic for any middle or high school student interested in space exploration and the mysteries of our universe. the face, as it is commonly known, is a rock formation on mars that some people believe resembles a human face, leading to speculation about its origins and possible extraterrestrial connections. in the 1970s, during the viking missions to mars, images were captured by nasa's orbiters that showed a large, rocky formation on the martian surface with two distinct eye like depressions and a mouth like opening. this striking similarity to a face prompted intense debate among astronomers and the general public. skeptics argue that it is just a natural geological feature shaped by wind erosion and other weathering processes over time, and that our perception of a face is a simple illusion. however, some researchers and theorists believe there could be something more to the face than just a coincidence. some hypotheses propose that the face could be an artificial construction left by a long lost martian civilization, possibly indicating their technological prowess. this theory gained further traction when the face appeared to be looking at nasa's mars global surveyor as it orbited the planet. others suggest that the face might have been formed by a natural process, such as a meteor impact, which could have created the facial features as a result of thermal shock or other forces. despite the various theories and explanations put forward over the years, no concrete evidence has been found to support any of these hypotheses. the most likely explanation for the face on mars is that it is just a naturally occurring rock formation that, through the vagaries of nature, appears to have a face like structure. however, the allure of the unknown and the possibility of discovering extraterrestrial life or ancient civilizations on mars will undoubtedly continue to fuel the debate among scientists and enthusiasts alike. in conclusion, the face on mars is an intriguing topic that captures the imagination of middle and high school students interested in space exploration. while the true origins of the face remain uncertain, it serves as an example of the mysteries and wonders that lie within our solar system, waiting to be discovered and understood.",0,0,0.00762308604310027

"studying venus remains a worthy pursuit the author makes a compelling case that studying venus remains a worthy scientific endeavor, despite the formidable dangers it presents. in the article the challenge of exploring venus, several key points of evidence are presented to support this assertion. firstly, venus provides a unique opportunity to learn about the evolution of terrestrial planets. as earth's sister planet, studying venus can yield insights into how planetary conditions like temperature, atmosphere and geography developed over time. comparative planetology allows scientists to better understand earth's formation and long term climate stability. any new information gained has value, even if acquiring it poses risks. further evidence is that technological advances are gradually reducing those risks and making exploration more feasible. robotic probes like the soviet genera spacecraft in the 1970s showed exploration is possible with dedicated engineering. current technologies like hemostat balloons could explore venus's atmosphere safely for longer periods. the article discusses ongoing projects by nasa and other space agencies working to develop durable materials and sustainable power sources capable of enduring venus's hellish environment. with each successful mission, our understanding grows while hazards lessen. in conclusion, the author makes a reasoned case that studying venus holds continual worth as a field of scientific inquiry. though dangers exist, valuable geological and atmospheric data can be collected to inform planetary science. by exploring one of earth's closest celestial neighbors, we expand human knowledge with applications that may one day aid problems like climate change back on our own world. technologies also progress in a way that incrementally tames venus's hazards, creating new opportunities down the line. for these sound evidentiary reasons, the pursuit of venus exploration remains scientifically justified and holds promise of ongoing rewards.",0,0,0.0005322902875057262

"dear ms. principal, in regards to the change in rules, which state that students must maintain a b average to be able to participate in sports or other activities, i agree with you 100 ! enforcing this law will help to push the students to keep up their grades. school was made for kids to learn and if they decide to slack off for sports i believe they should not be handed the privilege of such activities. if they would like to be in these activities well then they should try to keep a focus on school and then be given the privilege. maintaining a b average should not be so difficult for students, with a little effort and concentration anything can be accomplished. in addition, i would think that this rule would make students want to try harder in school and be able to achieve a b or higher grade average. for example, if a c average student would like to participate in a specific sport then he she will have to give more effort to getting a b average and being given the ability to participate in this specific sport. i believe this rule will help many students to achieve educational goals and put their knowledge to the test. lastly, i agree with the rule that is now being enforced and i believe it will help the school's students to participate and concentrate more in class. this rule will teach students that being able to participate in sports and other school activities is a privilege and to earn a privilege they must work hard. i believe this was a well thought out rule and should be enforced in other schools as well. this rule will help the school and its students to get a better feeling for privileges and the way to earn them.",1,0,0.487453496291091
"it is vitally important that students maintain a b average or higher in order to participate in sports and other activities. such academic requirements can benefit students, parents, and schools in several ways. first and foremost, it encourages students to prioritize their schoolwork and puts academic performance as a top priority. it also cultivates good learning habits and time management skills, better preparing students for future academic endeavors. furthermore, having such standards in place will allow parents to know that their children are being held to a higher standard when it comes to their school performance, as well as giving them peace of mind that the activities their children take part in will still be held to that same standard. finally, schools can make sure that their educational institutions are held in high regard and that their students have sufficient academic qualifications that they are taking the appropriate steps towards reaching their desired outcome. in conclusion, having a minimum b average to be eligible for sports and other activities is essential to ensure that students are taking academics seriously, that parents are being provided with the peace of mind that their children are being held accountable, and that the school is held in high regard.",0,0,6.266347486158944e-05
"dear senator, i am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president by popular vote. i believe that the electoral college is an outdated and undemocratic system that has no place in a 21st century democracy. there are many reasons why i believe the electoral college should be abolished. first, it is undemocratic. the electoral college gives more power to voters in less populous states than to voters in more populous states. this is because each state has a number of electoral votes equal to the number of its representatives in congress, plus its two senators. this means that each voter in wyoming has about three times as much power as each voter in california. second, the electoral college often results in a president who does not win the popular vote. this has happened five times in american history, including most recently in 2016. in these cases, the candidate who won the most votes nationwide was not elected president. this is a clear injustice, as it means that the majority of voters have had their voices ignored. third, the electoral college encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a small number of swing states that are likely to be close. this means that they neglect the needs of voters in other states, who are effectively ignored. for these reasons, i believe that the electoral college should be abolished and the president should be elected by popular vote. this would be a more democratic and fair system that would give all voters an equal voice. i urge you to support this important reform. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,0,0.006563768414757473
"f am in favor of the continued operation of zoos as they play a vital role in conservation and education. here are my reasons firstly, zoos provide a safe haven for endangered species that may be at risk of extinction due to various factors such as habitat destruction or poaching. fn these controlled environments, zoos can help to protect and preserve these animals by providing them with a safe place to live, breed, and thrive. for example, the san diego zoo has been successful in breeding giant pandas, which are an endangered species. secondly, zoos serve as important educational institutions that teach people about different animal species and their habitats. they offer visitors the opportunity to see and learn about animals that they may not have the chance to encounter in the wild. additionally, zoos can help to raise awareness about conservation efforts and the threats facing various species. for instance, the bronx zoo in new york has a program called wildlife conservation society which is dedicated to saving wildlife and wild places worldwide. lastly, zoos also contribute to research and scientific advancements in the field of animal behavior and biology. by observing animals in captivity, researchers can gain valuable insights into their behavior, physiology, and genetics. this information can then be used to develop better conservation strategies and improve the care of animals in captivity. fn conclusion, while there are certainly some ethical concerns surrounding the operation of zoos, f believe that the benefits they provide in terms of conservation, education, and research outweigh these concerns. as long as zoos continue to prioritize the wellbeing of their animals and focus on their role in preserving and protecting endangered species, they should be allowed to continue operating.",0,0,1.759660923295966e-06

"there are many ways to travel, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. some people prefer to travel alone, while others prefer to travel in a group. there are pros and cons to both options. one advantage of traveling in a group is that you have someone to help you with logistics. a tour guide can help you plan your trip, took your transportation and accommodation, and give you advice on what to see and do. this can oe especially helpful if you are visiting a place for the first time. another advantage of traveling in a group is that it can oe more affordable. when you took transportation and accommodation for a group, you can often get a discount. and, if you are traveling with a tour company, they may oe role to negotiate better rates for you. a disadvantage of traveling in a group is that you may not get to see everything you want to see. you may have to compromise on your itinerary and go where the group goes. and, if you are traveling with a tour company, they may have a set itinerary that you have to follow. another disadvantage of traveling in a group is that you may not get to meet as many people as you would if you were traveling alone. when you travel in a group, you usually stick together and don't have as much opportunity to meet locals. so, there are pros and cons to both traveling alone and traveling in a group. it depends on your preferences and what you are looking for in a trip. if you want someone to help you with logistics and don't mind compromising on your itinerary, then traveling in a group may oe the best option for you. but, if you want complete freedom and flexibility, then traveling alone may oe the better choice.",0,0,0.08259409885845675
"the challenge of exploring venus as the author suggested to study is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it can happen. the reason humens should explore the unknown venus is becuase it was the closest planet to earth terms of density and size. venus is dangers for a humen to explore but not an unman spacecraft to go near the surface. venus is tricky and challanging to explore becuase of the high temeratures that average 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than earth. venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. even though mercury is the closet to our sun. on the depths of the surface of venus there is alot going on, as in erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightign strikes. scientists are already discussing how to visit the venus surface which means they also want to explore and study venus. venus once have been like earth like planet in our solar system. it has some land features if rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. venus is sometimes our nearest option for a planetary visit, given the long time frames of space travel. the value of returning to venus seems unlikly. nasa is creating a blimp like vehicle to hover 30 or more miles above the roiling venusian landscape. the almost easy task for the vehicle would use solar power becuase the sun would be above it all the time. even in high altitude the climate is still pretty hot that is around 170 degree fahrenheit. the downfall to being so high up above 30 or more miles is not much research will go on becuase the limited view we well get. more importantly is that scientist can't get samples of rocks, gases, and anything else since the spacecraft will be high up. scientist is now looking at old technology called mechanical computers. the old technology uses gear and levers but not electronics at all. modern computers are more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. mechanical parts are more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces then a computer. what i think is that venus is worth the pursuit despite the danger it can bring. venus does have value to be explored because who doesn't love a challenge? i sure do love a challenge.",1,1,0.9991086568954637

"distance learning offers students the option to attend classes from home through online resources like video conferencing. while there can be benefits to distance learning, i do not think it is the ideal choice for most students. there awe some advantages to distance learning. it allows students to save time by avoiding transportation to and from school each day. this extra time could be used for sleep, homework, ow other activities. distance learning also provides flexibility that could benefit students who have health issues, participate in extwacuwwiculaw activities, ow have other commitments outside of school. for some highly motivated students, distance learning may suit thaw schedules and learning styles better than traditional unperson classes. however, distance learning is likely not the best choice for the average student. many students thrive on social interaction and benefit academically and personally from facetoface contact with teachers and peers. the school environment helps students stay focused and motivated, while distance learning requires strong self discipline to study independently at home each day. it can also be difficult for students to get thaw questions answered quickly ow to collaborate on group projects from afar. while technology aims to replicate the classroom experience, online interactions often lack the richness of unperson discussions and activities. overall, distance learning fills a niche for certain students but is not a replacement for the traditional school experience that works best for most kids. the social and academic support of unperson classes outweigh the convenience of learning from home via distance programs. for the average student, attending classes at school each day continues to provide the optimal learning environment.",0,0,0.0005140544950683679
"dear state senator, despite some of the risky things that can come along with electoral college voting, voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. some people therefore think it is useful and some on the other hand think that it is unfair and that it should be changed. fortunately though one thing that an electoral college can promise you is a certainty of outcome. a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible. it happened in 2000, but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. for example in 2012's election with obama and romney, obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney. because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a big electoral vote victory. moving right along, the electoral college also can avoid run off elections. the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. for instance, nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes while winning a majority in the electoral college. that situation then creates pressure which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the electoral college. therefore, there would be a clear winner.",1,1,0.9069563390930003
"dear principal, your considering changing school police so that students mal not participate in school sports or other activities unless the have at least a b average, and i as a student think that is a good idea and should be put in order as soon as possible. kids who are looking forward to school sports should strive to get bring up their grades because once the time come and practice for these sports take place after school, students will find it hard to get there homework done and turned in on time. not getting homework finished will lower their grade, and if the're required to have a b average instead of a c average, then when ever a grade falls it will fall to a c which is still pasting. if the required grade average is a c then when and if their grade falls, even just a little it will most likely fall to a d which is failing and could potentially cause them to be held back. on the other hand if students are required to have a b average to participate in school sports the later in the future mal star to those standards in high school where there is a great chance with the grades and the sports, a possible scholarship could be handed to them to get into collage. sincerell, student name",1,1,0.999931546269283
"so a lot of people think that the face on mars is an alien type of structure. people say this kind of things because they have no roof that it's a formation just like earth have formations. i'm here to tell you people that that's a type of formation that havens. like gavin said it's a type of landform that havens in the middle butte in the snake river plain of idaho. i'm going to tell you why i agree. us as a nasa team we work hard to solve what it was such as research, scientists working, and our team that saved the picture. all of us tried to figure out what it was yes we might have thought that it was some type of alien structure but like i said working hard got us where we needed to be. after what we needed to figure out we realized that it wasn't some alien structure using the rule of thumb we saw the picture 3 times bigger. after we saw that image we automatically realized that it was a simple formation same as what havens to earth. example like what haven to colorado. it used to have a river but after years the water started to evaporate, and it started forming big giant rocks. that's why i don't thing that its some kind of alien structure.",1,1,0.9949627831169768

"i strongly believe that pairing older and younger students together is an excellent idea. this arrangement allows for a mutually beneficial relationship in which the older student can assist the younger student and the younger student can learn from the older one. in addition, the older student can have a positive influence on the younger student, such as inspiring them to pursue certain goals or careers. one of the most significant advantages of this pairing is that it allows for the exchange of knowledge and skills. older students have more experience and can offer guidance and advice to younger students. on the other hand, younger students can bring new perspectives and ideas to the table. by working together, both students can learn from each other and improve their understanding of various subjects. furthermore, older and younger students can also help each other in other areas outside of school. for example, if a younger student is being bullied, the older student can step in and defend them. this kind of support can be invaluable in helping the younger student feel more comfortable and confident. in addition to the academic benefits, pairing older and younger students can also lead to the formation of strong friendships. when students are paired together, they have the opportunity to get to know each other on a deeper level, and this can lead to the development of a strong bond. overall, i believe that pairing older and younger students is a highly beneficial arrangement that can lead to academic success, personal growth, and the formation of strong friendships. schools should consider implementing programs that pair older and younger students together to foster a more inclusive and supportive learning environment.",0,0,1.2816475916900423e-05
