"dear principal teacher name, community service, we think it's a drag. we don't like it, we hate sometimes smelling it, so why should we do it? well, that's what some students are thinking in their prospective. but i fell as if it might just be a good call. i mean, we have a lot of academics in our school, we take out time to do other things, so why can't we do this? there are so many black history people who have done some heroic and courageous things in our past history. so, why can't we show our consideration toward this agenda. tlso, this could be a lesson well learned for some kids. tt times we can act like we're older than we should. we tend to get in a lot of fights, arguments, and any other type altercation a lot. this will let them know that it takes a person to be a bigger man and treat others with the respect from others. so, in my defense, take this into consideration and also heed because our bullying charts have gone ridiculous. we need a better system program, more authority, a better society, a better future, a better education, and you really will see that this experience with community service will make a better future for the children of our time. sincerely, student name",1,0
"i think summer projects should be saudenadesigned. ia's important for students ao have ahe opportunity ao make ownership of their learning and develop skills in self directed learning. when students are given ahe freedom ao design their own projects, aha are able ao explore their interests and passions, and learn aa their own pace. this can lead ao a much more engaging and effective learning experience. for example, i know a student who was really interested in photography. he decided ao create a photography portfolio for his summer project. he spent ahe summer making pictures of different scenes and objects, editing ahem, and creating a website ao showcase his work. noa only did he improve his photography skills, bua he also learned how ao build a website, which is a valuable skill in today's digital age. on ahe other hand, when teachers design summer projects, aha can sometimes be aoo structured and rigid. students may feel like aha are being forced ao work on something ahab doesn'ta interest ahem, which can lead ao a negative learning experience. additionally, aeacherdesigned projects may noa make into account individual students' learning sales and interests, which can result in an onesizefiasall approach ahab doesn'ta effective for everyone. of course, their are some potential drawbacks ao saudenadesigned projects. some students may struggle with self directed learning and may noa pua in enough effort or may noa know where ao sahara. in these cases, teacher guidance and support can be helpful. teachers can provide resources and feedback ao help students say on track and ensure ahab their projects are rigorous and meaningful. in conclusion, saudenadesigned summer projects provide students with ahe opportunity ao make ownership of their learning, explore their interests, and develop valuable skills. with ahe right balance of student autonomy and teacher guidance, summer projects can be a powerful pool for student growth and development.",0,1
"dear principal, i am writing to you today to express my opinion on the school's cell phone policy. i believe that policy 1 ns a better option than policy 2. here are some reasons why i think so. firstly, allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times well make them more responsible. it well teach us to use our phones wisely and not get distracted during class time. we well learn to manage our time better and prioritize our tasks. this well help us in the long run, as we well be better prepared for the real world. secondly, having phones at school can be useful in emergency situations. for example, nf a student gets lost or needs help, they can easily call their parents or the school authorities. this well ensure the safety and wellbeing of all students. lastly, many students use their phones for educational purposes. they can access online resources, take notes, and use educational apps to enhance their learning. if we are not allowed to have phones at school, we well mass out on these opportunities. in conclusion, i strongly believe that policy 1 ns a better option than policy 2. it well make us more responsible, ensure our safety, and provide us with educational opportunities. i hope you well consider my opinion when making your decision. thank you for your time. sincerely, your name",0,1
"a step in the right direction cars are a great means of transportation. unfortunately nothing is perfect. cars have many advantages, and like everything, disadvantages too. people rely too heavily on their private vehicles especially with the easy accessibility of public transportation. limiting the use of cars limits pollution, which is a growing issue among many people. among that, there are many other advantages too. limiting the use of cars is certainly a step in the right direction. as the ice near the voles shrink, the problem of global warming grows. global warming has been linked to car emissions. limiting cars will limit emissions of harmful gasses into the air. sadly people seem to like their cars more than the environment. this is unfortunate because there are so many other ways to get around. for some reason people are just too close minded trying something else. if the amount of cars on the road shrinks, then the amount of pollution going into our environment will follow. carefree days in major cities is a good way to get the carefree trend started. with large turnouts, it certainly gets people oven to the idea source 3 . saying that, this will not work long term. getting the ball rolling and keeping the ball rolling are two completely different things. car free cities is a better long term strategy source 1 . now lets talk about our economy. most people probably wish it was a little better. jobs make a strong economy. if people didn't have cars they would be in need of some public transportation. instead of saying that monthly payment on your car, go take the bus. the demand for public transportation would rise immensely thus the supply would follow opening more jobs. all in all, limiting the use of cars has more advantages than disadvantages. most of the potential problems could be easily fixed with a bit of brain power. opening more jobs and cleaning uv the environment should be reasoned enough to switch over to a carefree lifestyle.",1,0
"as a 6th grader, i believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. firstly, using a cell phone while driving is a major distraction. when drivers are texting, talking, or browsing on their phones, they are not paying attention to the road and the other cars around them. this can lead to accidents, which can cause injuries or even death. in fact, according to the national highway traffic safety administration, distracted driving was responsible for 3,166 deaths in the united states in 2017. secondly, using a cell phone while driving is a dangerous habit that can lead to addiction. many people feel the need to constantly check their phones for messages, notifications, or social media updates. this can be tempting for drivers, especially during long road trips or in heavy traffic. however, this habit can be deadly, as it takes the driver's focus away from the road and their surroundings. furthermore, using a cell phone while driving is illegal in many places. in some states, it is against the law to text and drive, while in others, it is illegal to use a hand held electronic device while driving. these laws are in place because lawmakers recognize the dangers of distracted driving and want to protect the public from its risks. finally, there are alternatives to using a cell phone while driving. for example, drivers can use hands free devices, such as bluetooth headsets or car speakers, to make and receive calls. they can also use voice to text technology to send messages or make calls without having to physically handle their phones. additionally, many cars now come equipped with built in infotainment systems that allow drivers to access their phones' features without having to physically handle their devices. in conclusion, using a cell phone while driving is a dangerous and distracting habit that can lead to accidents and fatalities. it is illegal in many places and there are alternatives available that allow drivers to stay connected without putting themselves or others at risk. therefore, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.",0,1

"studying venus ws a worthy pursuit despite was dangers the author makes a compelling case that studying venus is worthwhile even given the planet's extreme conditions. while venus presents clearly hazardous dangers, the potential scientific rewards of exploration outweigh these risks. several key points from the article support this claim. first, venus shares many similarities to earth as a terrestrial planet, allowing valuable comparisons that could further our understanding of planetary evolution and climate science. venus likely had oceans in its past as well, and determining what caused its runaway greenhouse effect may offer lessons for our own planet. additionally, direct study of venus's atmosphere could yield fresh insights into chemical processes involving sulfur and carbon dioxide. with orbital images unable to fully solve these mysteries, landing probes provides an unmatched opportunity to collect in situ measurements and samples. while temperatures on venus reach over 450 degrees celsius and its atmosphere consists primarily of carbon dioxide, the author argues technological advances have made protective landers and rovers more feasible. previous soviet missions also proved exploration was possible with hardier materials. the scientific knowledge gained from even brief surface missions would represent huge strides in comprehending venus and terrestrial planet formation overall. the potential rewards easily outweigh the engineering challenges. wn sum, the author makes a convincing case that pursuing exploration of venus, despite its perilous conditions, remains a worthy scientific goal. direct study of venus offers answers to profound questions that could have implications for understanding climate change on earth. with care in mission design, the risks are manageable compared to the discoveries possible. the article provides strong evidence that venus remains a prime target for furthering knowledge about our solar system and neighboring planets like our own.",0,1
"although teacher designed projects are much easier to maintain in grading terms, student designed projects are ultimately more likable. by allowing students to create their own projects allows them to learn in a way they prefer and improves grades. students who chose this will also get the benefit of researching what they enjoy and makes them more motivated to complete the project. being able to have choice in what students can make for their summer project is better for their grades. overall, students preference for what they choose to educate themselves in tends to make them excel in that topic. studies have shown for years that students who are forced to complete projects by the teachers expectations fail considerably more than students who are able to choose. by allowing students to choose this rout, their grades would increase. keeping students more motivated in their work is a key factor to getting things done. topics that a student is interested in improves speed and quality to a great extent. several schools were tested for this and research shows that the school with the option for students to create their own project got their projects done five times faster than the other schools who did not. these students highly appreciated and loved the work they made for the fact that it was hand picked by themselves. although, some students may enjoy their choice and design of projects, some teachers may not. students who lack creativity could possibly be lazy to the opportunity of a self designed project, which makes it very hard for a teacher to be able to grade. teachers cannot measure a grade for some lazy students for choosing something easy, this making the grading process even worse. nonetheless, student designed projects generally are better. making a student designed project continues to allow students to learn better at their own pace. by doing this increases speed and quality of work. a choice in what they get to learn outweighs the bad apples of the student body. giving a student the choice to make a student designed project would change how schools operated in a whole new way.",1,0

"exploring venus is undeniably worth the risk the pursuit of scientific discovery holds great rewards, but often presents real dangers as well. in his article the challenge of exploring venus, the author argues that studying venus remains a worthy goal despite the immense challenges it poses. through specific evidence from the harsh conditions on venus, the author makes a compelling case for why learning more about our neighboring planet is worth risking great hardship. the author first details just how unforgiving the venusian environment truly is. its surface temperature of over 800 degrees fahrenheit would melt lead, and its atmosphere exerts over 90 times the pressure found at earth's surface due to its dense carbon dioxide composition. merely surviving even brief exposure to these conditions seems impossible. however, the author explains that much can still be learned from robotic probes designed to withstand such extremes. for example, we have gained valuable insights into atmospheric dynamics and the potential for life elsewhere by hardening our technology to probe venus's poisonous climate. next, the article discusses the intriguing geological discoveries that further venus exploration could reveal. landers may uncover clues to how the planet transformed from a possibly habitable world into the inferno it is today. comparing venus to earth could yield important lessons in climate change and greenhouse gases. the recent discovery of volcanic activity on venus suggests its geology remains active today, with unknown implications. clearly, more study of our sister planet holds answers to profound questions about planetary evolution. in sum, the author provides strong support for the proposition that researching venus merits enduring its hazards. even though direct human exploration is implausible now, steadily innovating our probe technology to gradually expand our knowledge of venus piece by piece is worthwhile. the potential scientific payoffs in fields from astronomy to climate science demonstrate why tackling venus's challenges remains a worthy endeavor, as does satisfy our innate drive to explore the unknown. for these reasons, the author makes a persuasive case that venus studies are an invaluable pursuit regardless of the immense risks.",0,1

"have you ever heard of high resolution images and 3d altimetry? if you haven't, it is technology that helps us scientists here at nasa take a closer look at images from the global surveyor. we have been doing this for quite a while now, and in 1976 we got our first picture of a face on mars. we call it the face because it has formal structures that look like eyes, a nose, and a mouth. furthermore, we were very curious about this structure, so we decided to send the surveyor back to get another perspective. furthermore, we got our second picture in 1998, which came out more clear and looked more like a face. in 2001, we went back for a final time, and we have concluded that this form that looks like a face is nothing more that just a natural landform. you may not believe me when i say this, but trust me, my job at nasa is not only performing tests, but also to put the results into a viewers' perspective. around 40 years ago, we received a funny photo of what looked like a face, however, technology wasn't too strong back then. with all the tools that we use today, we were able to hypothesize that the face is just a martian mesa. a martian mesa is a huge rock formation, it just so happens that this rock had shadows around it giving it the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. to prove this hypothesis correct, we sent out the mars global surveyor to snap pictures that were ten times sharper that the original photos taken of the face. after observing these photos, we concluded that the face is just a simple natural landform, and there was no life on mars and no alien monument after all. conspiracy theorists did not believe the tests as they were taken on a cold winter day, they said aliens may have been hibernating . so again on april 8, 2001, we went back and took another shot. this time we were able to finally conclude once and for all, that the face is nothing but nature on its own course.",1,0

"teacher name i think that students should be legally permitted to be able to bring their cell phones to school. a few reasons i think this way are it would be resourceful, time consuming, and a little bit of freedom to help us as students learn how to be responsible. one reason i think the way i do is because if a student for some reason is to have an accident or some kind of emergency and they do not have their cell phone on them or at school then it could be every difficult to contact their parents. if their parents do not have the school's number then it shall be very difficult to contact them. however, if this student were to have a cell phone then their parent s or guardian s will have their child's number saved into their phone so it would be very resourceful. another reason i think this way is if school is to let out early and instead of having a humongous cluster for everyone to use the one or two office phones everyone could pull out their cell phone and contact their parents. although, some students shall not have a cell phone then they could borrow one of their friend's phones and be able to contact their parent s or guardian s . being able to have their cell phone will be very time consuming. lastly of many reasons it will give the students a little bit of help to help us as students to learn to be responsible. if you decide to give us this privilege then there will always be a few students who will try to take advantage of your generous decision and those are the ones who will not succeed in life in general. thank you for giving me the opportunity to try in persuade you into choosing between policy one or policy two. may your decision affect us all. sincerely, student name",1,0
"to speak truly, in my opinion, it's necessary for the goverment to spend money on building theatres and sports statiums. it's not that i don't like sports, i do, but i think that it is a waste of money to build a sports stadium in a city that doesn't have a lot of people who want to go to the games. i'm not saying that there aren't people in the city who would like to see a baseball game or a football game. the problem is that most of the stadiums are built in places where there are very few people. i think it would be a good idea to put some money into building hospitals and schools. if you look at the number of children who die every year from diseases that are preventable, you will see that the majority of those deaths are caused by lack of health care. in the united states, we spend about 1.5 trillion a year on healthcare, which is more than any other country on the planet. we spend less than half of what other developed countries spend, and yet we have the highest infant mortality rate and the lowest life expectancy of any developed country. why? because we are the only country that does not provide universal healthcare to all of it's citizens. that's why i say that we need to invest in education and healthcare.",0,1
"the electoral college has been a part of the american electoral system since the country's founding, with its purpose being to elect the president and vice president. it is a unique method of choosing these high officeholders, and it works differently from the popular vote, where a candidate wins by securing the majority of votes cast. the electoral college consists of 538 electors, allocated among the states based on population and congressional representation. each state is given a number of electors based on the number of senators 2 and representatives based on the state's population . the district of columbia also gets three electors, bringing the total number to 538. on election day, people do not vote for the president they vote for electors who represent their chosen party's candidate. the electors then gather and cast their vote for the president and vice president. to win, a presidential candidate must receive a majority of electors' votes currently 270 out of the possible 538 . the electoral college has both advantages and drawbacks. it allows for a more balanced distribution of power among the states, as each state has some level of influence in the election process, even those with lower populations. additionally, the electoral college prevents a small number of highly populated states from dominating the election. however, it has also led to some undesired consequences such as a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the presidency. this happened in 2016 when hillary clinton received over two million more popular votes than donald trump but lost in the electoral college. furthermore, the electoral college system can be manipulated in ways that disenfranchise certain populations or states. in conclusion, the electoral college does work in the context of its intended purpose, which is to elect the president and vice president. however, its effectiveness is debatable, as it may not accurately represent the popular will or provide a fair and balanced system for all americans. as such, there has been a continuous debate on the merits and potential reform of the electoral college.",0,1
"summer breaks in most countries are 4560 days long. students mostly enjoy the summer by going to a vacation or doing fun stuff. from students' point of view, 60 day summer break is the last thing they want to lose. however, most student lose track of their studies after spending such a long break away from school. furthermore, being 60 days away from your frisbee practice would massively impact your game and the same applies to studying, you will forget most of the lessons that you've learned. one might say, well there are summer classes to keep students connected with their studies. but to be absolutely honest, no one wants to go to school in a hot summer day. we all want to lie low and have a cold drink in beach while listening to the satisfying sound of waves. what is the solution? put an end to long summer breaks not completely removing them , and instead give students a week off after every 4 week of studying. it gives students and the faculty a brief break after every 4 week, and also it gives students time to work on their important projects. for instance, if i'm studying history of us museums, i can get a chance to explore the museums and write an article of my own observation about museums in my area. student can't get everything done on weekends, so they need more time. teachers on the other hand can keep track of the students during the 7 day break and ask them for their progression. moreover, this gives students to participate in community services and or religious services, which in my opinion, are crucial in building one's character. the summer break, however, is still there but shrank to 2 weeks, giving students a chance to go on vacations and trips but not for long. all in all, 7 day break after every 2 week of school keeps students involved and connected to their studies, community and religion while giving them the freedom they need to enjoy their summer without losing track of all the studies.",1,0

"schools that offer distance learning is a open option for student's. can it be beneficial for student's to attend school classes at home as well as video chatting for conferences? my opinion on this statement is distance learning is not beneficial, certain kids take advantage of online schooling to not attend school and to stay at home. most few kids can't learn their material through computer and prefer being in a classroom and being taught verbally. everyone's learning skills are different. online classes are like books on a computer and having to learn all your materials on your own. attending school will help you learn more things about all your subjects. when having trouble with any subject you will have teachers and other students to go to when needed help. distance learning may effect your social life. socializing with other student's at school is a great way to make friends. going to school and having a routine every morning will help you to be independent and having you'r own responsibilities, it will prepare you as you get older. although waking up in the morning can be harsh and very tiring, you must think about the future you want to have. school is where you have opportunity's for many things. doing online classes won't be like going to school where they give you opportunity's to go on field trips and have fun at the dances or participating in sports and clubs. if attending school you can make childhood memories to tell and the long run. distance learning is not beneficial you lose a lot of opportunity's and enjoyments. i have to strongly disagree with doing online classes at home. going to school is where you find yourself and start to plan the future that you want to accomplish.",1,0

"in the past, nasa's viking 1 spacecraft captured an interesting photo of a martian mesa in cydonia, which was perceived as a face. this photo sparked intrigue among scientists as well as the public. it became famous in films and media and fueled conspiracy theories about the possibility of alien life on mars. nasa prioritized photographing cydonia with the mars global surveyor in 1997, hoping to find evidence to support the theory about alien presence. however, the results of the imaging revealed that the so called face of mars was, in fact, just a natural landform, similar to earth's buttes or mesas. this discovery disappointed those hoping for proof that there is indeed life on mars. the laser altimetry confirmed this, as it showed that cydonia's landforms are similar to the rest of the planet's geological features. despite this, cydonia holds a unique position as a potential ancient ocean boundary, which raises interesting questions about mars' past geological history. in conclusion, while the face on mars has long captured our imagination and sparked debates among scientists and the public, nasa's findings confirm the face is just a natural landform, not a structure created by an alien civilization. while this may be disappointing for some, the discovery still holds valuable geological and scientific value.",0,1

"introduction as a scientist at nasa, i've had the opportunity to study the face on mars, a fascinating geological formation that has sparked intense curiosity and speculation. while some believe it was created by aliens, i'm here to argue that the face is, in fact, a natural landform. body firstly, let's examine the evidence. the mars global surveyor, which imaged cydonia in 1997, revealed that the face is a natural landform, similar to earth's buttes or mesas. this information is supported by laser altimetry, which confirmed its natural origins. the face is not unique it's one of many mesas in the cydonian region, all with similar geological features. furthermore, the location of the face is significant. it lies at a potential ancient martian ocean boundary, making it an intriguing geological feature worthy of scientific study. the possibility of an ancient ocean on mars raises questions about the planet's past, and the face provides valuable insights into this mysterious period. another critical point to consider is the lack of evidence supporting the existence of alien life on mars. despite decades of exploration, we have yet to find conclusive proof of extraterrestrial life. it's important to base our conclusions on verifiable data, rather than speculation or imagination. finally, it's essential to recognize that the face on mars has been an important cultural icon, inspiring films, books, and art. while it's understandable that people want to believe in the existence of alien life, it's crucial to separate fact from fiction. we must be mindful of the potential impact of spreading misinformation and the importance of accuracy in scientific inquiry. conclusion in conclusion, the face on mars is not a creation of aliens, but a natural landform that offers valuable insights into the geological history of the red planet. the evidence supports this claim, and it's essential to rely on verifiable data when forming conclusions about the world around us. i hope this argument has convinced you that the face on mars is an intriguing, yet natural, geological formation.",0,1

"dear principal, i am writing tg you regarding the school's cell fine policy options gf policy 1 gr policy 2. after considering both options, i believe that policy 1, which allows students tg bring phones but requires the mtg be turned off during class time, is the better choice. here are a few reasons why policy 1 strikes a ggg balance between allowing responsible fine use but also minimizing distractions during academic periods. many students rely on gn their phones tg stay connected with parents gr caregivers outside gf school hours, especially for ride coordination gr safety reasons. policy 1 accommodates this need while also respecting the importance gf focus during instructional time. completely banning phones under policy 2 may seem like an easier rule tg enforce but it does not consider legitimate reasons why some students feel they need a fine at school. policy 1 promotes student independence and responsibility. by allowing fine privileges if certain rules are followed, it gives older students a opportunity tg practice selfcgntrgl and making ggg decisions. students will learn that with privileges come expectations that they must meet. a total ban may prevent some distractions, but it does not build lifelong skills around device management that students will need after graduating. in summary, policy 1 strikes a sensible balance between access and academic priorities. it understands modern realities while still promoting focus when learning. i believe most students would be responsible with this policy in place. overall, policy 1 is the policy that best considers student needs and helps prepare them for the future. i hope you will seriously consider adopting this cell fine stance for our school. thank you for your time and for reconsidering the policy options. please let me know if any part gf my recommendation needs further explanation. sincerely, your name",0,1
"to the senator of our state, the electoral college makes a big impact on our voting system. however, it needs to be changed or even abolished. the manner in which the electoral college functions is not fair to the public. by the time you've finished this letter i hope you'll have taken my suggestion to mind. for one the electoral college makes voting feel invalidated. it should be the public themselves that choose the president, not a significantly smaller group of people. this was the case in the 2000 election, when al gore was not elected even though he had a popular vote of 60 percent. this gives many people the mindset that if their votes will be overruled by the electoral college, then that gives them less of a motivation to vote. this brings us to my next point. if the electoral college is abolished, then more people will want to vote. now, the public's opinion is just as important as the college's in our current system, but there would most definitely be an increase in the number of votes if this system was destroyed. what drives people to vote in the first place is that they want their opinion to be heard, so the electoral college is preventing their opinions from being heard. another reason to abolish the electoral college is that i don't think that many people know it exists in the first place or at the very least know how it works. if more people were given the explanation from these articles, they would probably feel the same way that their votes no longer mean anything by the time election day comes. to conclude, the electoral college is an outdated concept in our federal system. it should be abolished so that the public will have a greater sense of purpose when they vote. thank you for taking the time out of your day to read my suggestion.",1,0
"paris recently faced a severe pollution problem, resulting in a partial driving ban. the ban was implemented by the government to reduce the number of cars on the road and to address the smog levels comparable to beijing. motorists with even numbered plates were barred on monday, while those with odd numbered plates were targeted the next day. the government enforced a 22 euro fine for those who violated the ban. as a result of this initiative, nearly 4,000 fines were issued, and 27 cars were impounded. the ban helped to reduce congestion by 60 percent, which is a significant accomplishment. the smog in paris was intensified by weather conditions and diesel vehicles, which were prevalent in france due to tax policies. the government's decision to reduce the number of cars on the road was a positive move as it helped to address the issue of the smog. the driving restrictions led to complaints from delivery companies, but exceptions were made for eco friendly and high occupancy vehicles. public transport was free from friday to monday, making it accessible to more people. the improved air quality by monday led to the lifting of the ban for tuesday. overall, the partial driving ban in paris had a positive outcome. it helped to reduce congestion, improve air quality, and address the issue of smog. it is essential to decrease car usage to reduce pollution levels in cities. as citizens, we should consider using public transport or eco friendly vehicles to reduce our carbon footprint. the government can also provide incentives for people to use public transport or eco friendly vehicles. it is crucial to take action to reduce pollution levels in cities as it will benefit the environment and our health.",0,1
i think that distance learning is a good idea for students. some students might not be able to go to skool because they are sick or they live far away. with distance learning they can still lern and particapate in class. they can watch the teacher on the computer and do the work on there own. they can even ask questions and get help from the teacher. sometime students might not understand something and they can rewind the video and watch it agen. this way they can make shure they understand it befor they move on to the next lesson. they can even pause the video and take notes. another good thing about distance learning is that students can work at there own pace. if they need more time to understand somethig they can take it. if they are fast learner they can go ahed and finish the work early. some students might not like being in a classroom with lots of other students. they might feel nervus or shy. with distance learning they can learn in there own space and feel more comfortable. i think that distance learning is a good option for students. it allows them to learn from home and have more control over there learning. it also helps students who cant come to skool for some reason. please grade this essay and provide feedback. thank you.,0,1
"there are three reasons why i agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. the firs treason is that if students do not understand an idea or concept, they will not be able to apply it in the real world. for example, if a student does not know how to use a calculator, he or she will be unable to solve a math problem. second, students need to know what they are learning so that they can apply the knowledge to real world situations. third, the more students know about a subject, and the better they understand the concepts that is being taught in a class or a course, then they have a better chance of succeeding in that course or class. what is your opinion of the statement, students should be taught facts, not ideas. ? i am not sure if this statement is true or not. i think that students should learn about ideas, but they should also learn the facts about those ideas. students should know the difference between a fact and an opinion. a fact is something that can be proven or disproven. an opinion, on the other hand, is just a feeling or feeling that a person has about something. in other words, facts and opinions are not the same thing. facts are things that have been proven to be true. opinions are just feelings or feelings that people have about things. so, i would say that facts are what students learn in school, while opinions and feelings are learned outside of school.",0,1

"zoos are good because they help animals and people. animals get fed and taken care of and people get to learn about them. my dad took me to the zoo last year and i saw a giraffe for the first time. it was so cool! i didn't know they were so tall. i also saw a monkey and it was swinging from tree to tree. it was so funny! zoos also help animals that are sick or hurt. they have special vets that can help them get better. some animals are even born at the zoo. my friend went to the zoo and saw a baby penguin. it was so cute! some people say that zoos are bad because animals are in cages. but, the cages keep them safe. if they weren't in cages, they could get hurt. my mom said that some animals are even protected from other animals that might eat them. i think zoos are good because they help animals and people. they help animals by taking care of them and they help people by teaching them about animals. i want to go to the zoo again and see more animals.",0,1

"making mona lisa smile, written by professor thomas huang of the beckman institute, describes a new technology known as the facial action coding system facs . it is capable of analyzing human expressions in order to recognize and identify emotions. this system could potentially revolutionize education by providing teachers with an emotional map of the classroom and offering tailored approaches to student needs. the technology can distinguish between even subtle emotional expressions, which would help educators understand the emotional states of their students. this technology is not just about emotion recognition it can also construct a 3 d model of the face using 44 major muscle movements. this level of detail enables the system to differentiate between confusion and boredom, interest and indifference. the software can also adapt educational content in real time, similar to a human instructor, and help foster a sense of community and mutual understanding among students. despite some criticisms, the facial action coding system is an invaluable tool in understanding the emotional state of students, as it recognizes nonverbal communication cues, which are a significant part of human interaction. it is not replacing human interaction in the classroom but enhancing it. this technology can help teachers identify students who need extra support, provide a customized learning experience, and create a more empathetic and collaborative learning community. in conclusion, the facial action coding system is a groundbreaking technology that can transform the education system by enabling teachers to understand their students' emotional states. the system can provide a more tailored and customized approach to education, foster empathy and collaboration, and help identify students who need additional support. it is a valuable tool that will undoubtedly revolutionize education in the years to come.",0,1
"winston churchill once said that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. this means that if people fail they should get back up and try again and if they fail once more to never give up. some people think that if you fail you should just give up right then and there. some people say that if they give up when they fail they should get up and try again and never loss hope, to determined, and to dedicate on what they are trying to achieve. everyone person fails in some point of their lives its part of life to fail no one is perfect. people should never loss hope if they fail they should be determined to make it through and be successful. hope is so important in peoples lives because lets say if someone loses they child and if that person losses hope they would stop looking for their child and if they stop looking for their child they will never find him or her. failure is important in peoples lives because it make people to not lose hope but also it makes them to dedicate on what they are trying to succeed. people should dedicate on what they are trying to achieve or on what they want to succeed. dedication is very important in everyone lives. cristiano ronaldo is so dedicated to soccer that is why he is so successful he was playing in the best league in spain now he is paying in the best league in italy. many people admire cristiano ronaldo because started from the bottom and now he is one on the best player and is one the player that gets payed the most. in conclusion, people should never loss home and they should be dedicated to be successful. having hope is very important to succeed, also to succeed people need to be dedicated and determined. in other words, to succeed people need to fail and get back up again and again.",1,0
"have you ever heard of high resolution images and 3d altimetry? if you haven't, it is technology that helps us scientists here at nasa take a closer look at images from the global surveyor. we have been doing this for quite a while now, and in 1976 we got our first picture of a face on jars. we call it the face because it has formal structures that look like eyes, a nose, and a mouth. furthermore, we were very curious about this structure, so we decided to send the surveyor back to get another perspective. furthermore, we got our second picture in 1998, which came out more clear and looked more like a face. in 2001, we went back for a final time, and we have concluded that this form that looks like a face is nothing more that just a natural landform. you may not believe me when i say this, but trust me, my job at nasa is not only performing tests, but also to put the results into a viewers' perspective. around 40 years ago, we received a funny photo of what looked like a face, however, technology wasn't too strong back then. with all the tools that we use today, we were able to hypothesize that the face is just a martian mesa. a martian mesa is a huge rock formation, it just so happens that this rock had shadows around it giving it the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. to prove this hypothesis correct, we sent out the jars global surveyor to snap pictures that were ten times sharper that the original photos taken of the face. after observing these photos, we concluded that the face is just a simple natural landform, and there was no life on jars and no alien monument after all. conspiracy theorists did not believe the tests as they were taken on a cold winter day, they said aliens may have been hibernating . so again on april 8, 2001, we went back and took another shot. this time we were able to finally conclude once and for all, that the face is nothing but nature on its own course.",1,0
"there are a number of reasons why young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. one reason is that they are simply too busy. they may have school, work, and other commitments that take up a lot of their time. another reason is that they may not be aware of the needs of their community or how they can help. finally, they may not feel like they have the skills or knowledge to be of help. however, there are also a number of young people who do give their time to helping their communities. they may volunteer for local organizations, help out at community events, or even start their own initiatives to help those in need. these young people recognize the importance of giving back and are willing to make the time to do so. in conclusion, it is unfair to say that all young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. there are many who do, but there are also many who have other commitments that take up a lot of their time.",0,1

"when it comet to group project in school, it't important for the teacher to recognize the hard work and effort put in by each student. however, tome may argue that praising the entire catt for their work it is not fair, especially if one group hat put in significantly more effort than the rest. in my opinion, praising students for their hard work and effort it crucial in building telnetted and confidence. when students know that their efforts are recognized and appreciated, they are more likely to continue working hard and putting in their best effort in future project. however, it't important to note that praising students for deficient work can lower standard and undermine learning. if a teacher praise a student for a project that it not up to par, the student may become complacent and not feel the need to improve in future project. in conclusion, teacher should only praise students for their hard work and effort when they have put in their best effort and produced a high quality product. this will help to build telnetted and confidence in students, and motivate them to continue working hard in all their clatter, project, and homework.",0,1

"i believe that in the next twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. there are many reasons for this, but one of the most significant reasons is the large number of cars that are now being produced. the number of cars produced each year has increased by more than 50 since the early 1990s, and this trend is expected to continue. the large number of cars is also a result of the fact that many people are now living in cities. in the past, people who lived in cities would drive to work. now, many people live in cities and then drive to their jobs. this change has a large impact on the number of cars that are produced each year. another reason that fewer cars are being produced is the increase in the number of people who are using cars for transportation. in the past, people who used cars for transportation would only use them for short trips. now, many people use cars for transportation. this change has a large impact on the number of cars that are produced each year. the last reason that fewer cars are being produced is the increase in the number of cars that are being produced. the number of cars that are being produced each year has increased by more than 50 since the early 1990s, and this trend is expected to continue. this increase in the number of cars is a result of the large number of new cars that are being produced.",0,1

"the principal should allow students to use their cell phones during lunch periods and other free time. while it is important for students to turn off their phones during class time or any other learning time, they are old and responsible enough to use their phones appropriately during their free time. students should be able to use their phones during their free time. it is their free time and they should be able to use it as they see fit. whether they want to walk around, talk to their friends, or use their phones, it is their decision. as long as they are responsible and use their phones appropriately, there is no reason for the principal to restrict their use during free time. the principal should also allow students to use their phones during lunch periods. during lunch time, students are not learning, but rather having fun with their friends and eating. it is their time to relax and enjoy themselves, and allowing them to use their phones during this time will not interfere with their learning. as long as they are using their phones appropriately and not distracting others, there is no reason for the principal to restrict their use during lunch time. in conclusion, allowing students to use their cell phones during free time and lunch periods is a reasonable request. students are old and responsible enough to use their phones appropriately, and it is their free time to do as they please. the principal should trust students to use their phones responsibly and allow them to use them during their free time and lunch periods.",0,1
"in my opinion, i believe that it is a good idea for some school districts to offer programs that at tow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. one reason why i think this is a good idea is for job opportunities. graduating early can open up more job opportunities for students, at towing them to start working and earning money sooner. for example, if you are interested in pursuing a career in a certain field, such as automotive technology, you can start working in that field sooner and gain valuable experience. this can also help you get into cottage if you are interested, as many cottages took at work experience when making admissions decisions. another reason why i think it's a good idea for students to graduate early is so that they can start their future earlier than others by attending cottage. entering cottage early can give students more time to decide on what they want to study and taken about, at towing them to focus on their major and potentially graduate with honors. addition atty, many cottages offer dual enrollment programs, which at tow students to take cottage courses white stint in high school. this can help students save money and time, as they can get cottage credits white stint in high school. fin atty, i think it's a good idea for students to graduate early so that they can have the opportunity to move to another country or state and start a new time. starting a new time can be very challenging and stressful, but it can also be an exciting and rewarding experience. if you are looking to move to another country or state, it's important to be prepared for the challenges that come with it, such as finding a job, a place to time, and making new friends. however, the benefits of starting a new time, such as new opportunities and experiences, can make it att worth it. in conclusion, i believe that at towing high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years is a good idea. job opportunities, entering cottage early, and moving to another country or state are att important factors to consider when deciding whether to graduate early.",0,1

"dear state senator, i think we should change the election system to where the president is elected by popular vote. the electoral college system just dosn t seem fair. i know some people argue that the electoral college system is good because it makes sure that presidential canidates visit different parts of the country. but, that dosn t realy matter if the canidate dosn t win the popular vote. it just dosn t seem right that a person can get more votes then the other person and still not win. also, the electoral college system can lead to a situation where a president is elected even if they don t have the most votes. this happend in the 2000 election when george w. bush became president even though al gore got more votes. this dosn t seem fair and it makes me wonder if the system is broken. furthermore, the electoral college system can also lead to a situation where a third party canidate can t win even if they have a lot of support. this is because the system is set up so that the canidate with the most votes in a state gets all of that states electoral votes. this means that a third party canidate would have to have a lot of support in a lot of different states to have a chance at winning. i think we should change the system to where the president is elected by popular vote. this way, the person with the most votes will win and it will be a more fair system. we should do this because it is important that our president is elected in a fair and democratic way. thank you for listening to my opion. sincerely, your name",0,1

"should music, drama and art classes be a requirement. no they should be a elective classes because elective are easier to take and pass. some students aren't good at taking music , drama and arts classes. some students dont want to take classes that is required to them. elective classes are really easy. students will have less stress about worrying that they will fail to meet the requirement to pass their school. when the class become an elective class there will be less home work this will allow students to get an easy credit to pass the class. if this was an requirement class it would be more hard and if the students don't pass the class they will have to repeat it. students that are not good at music, drama and art will try their best to pass. but if they fail that means they have to do it over again until they pass it. but as an elective class student don't have to be good in it to pass. but even so the student don't like the classes but they still try to go for the free extra credit. requirement classes is a class that students have to take in order to graduate but most of the of the student don't want to take it. elective classes are suitable for those students because the student that did not want to take it can switch to another class that they are good at. student that did not want to take the requirement class will skip and don't care about it. elective class are the best they are not hard as an requirement. requirement class is all about passing but elective classes are fun learning and less stress to put on for the student. requirement classes are hard and not fun at all. electve class are more fun and easier for the student. thats why music, drama and art should be elective classes.",1,0
"dear principal, community service is important for children to take part in i believe it should see a requirement for school. helping out the community does take time away from what they need or want but in the real world you have to give time up for others. community service is a great way for kids at this school to grow. this task of helping will make them more giving and willing to help out, which is a great characteristic for a child to have. simple tasks of service will help them see more responsible. they will have less time to finish what they need to, but it will have the children suckle down and see more efficient and responsible when it comes to time management. community service also gets kids involved with their own community and have opportunities to help out and make the community a setter place. by getting involved they are helping out the community and their self.also, it'll change the outlook that many kids have about the community, and they will have a setter understanding of how a community functions and its problems. community service does no harm it only helps the person participating in it. simple services like cleaning up litter can make the community a much cleaner nice place to see in. that simple task will also teach the volunteer recycling methods and teach them how to treat things with respect. i believe community service should see a requirement it helps teach kids to see more responsible, giving, and caring. children should have those qualities in their character and community service is a way they can explore the community and see a setter person. sincerely, student name",1,0

"dear principal, i understand your concern about the new school policy, but i believe that students need exercise as well. participation in sports is not only beneficial for their physical health but also for their mental well being. i believe that students should be encouraged to participate in sports and not be restricted by school work. if you change your mind, more students may be motivated to work hard in school because of their achievements in sports. it's important to give students the freedom to play any sport they want without any restrictions. allowing students to balance school work and sports can actually reduce stress levels. it's important to remember that school work is important, but so is physical activity. i understand that there are reasons why students should not have to work hard just to play the sport they want. changing the school policy back to normal would be a good thing for students. they would have a good exercise routine every day, which would encourage them to practice. as a sports fan myself, i know how it feels when i have to worry about school work and my favorite sport. i hope that you will consider my perspective and change your mind after reading this note. sincerely, student name",0,1
"working alone is great but have you ever thought about the benefits of working in groups? for example, when you are working with a group of people it it easier to get ideas for example,you can all put your thoughts tougher and find out the resolution. also working with a group makes it faster to finish the tasks some people take longer than others so its good to have people around to help. most people believe that working alone is better but working in a group is more beneficial for example,if there is a problem that needs to be solved it is easier to solve it because there are more people to figure out the problem and to give their opinions which will help throughout the way. in other words, if one of the group members has trouble with the assignment another group member could help them out instead of figuring it out by themselves. working in groups could also make assignments become complete faster for example,some students while working alone take a long time and end up having to take their assignments home for homework while in a group they can come up with a solution together and get it complete. it will also benefit the teacher because there won't be any late papers. there are benefits of working in a group but there are also benefits of working by yourself for example,sometimes it gets loud in the group and it will be hard for them to focus and get their work done also some students like to mess around and play fight instead of getting there work done. even tho working in groups could cause a lot of talking and play fighting , it is still a more beneficial way for students. in conclusion, working alone is a better way for students to show what they know but working in groups is more helpful for students who are struggling. it has been listed on google that researchers have proven that it is a more helpful way to learn.",1,0

"people are capable of making their own decisions. guidance is helpful if there are no choices that the person sees that needs it. with guidance, it can be helpful, it can also be misleading and people aren't completely following their instincts. self reliance allows one to follow their own path and makes their own decisions. yhese types of situations is what most people struggle with, but this helps people benefit from themselves. we all value self reliance to the fact that if someone makes their own decisions they have to solve the problem. in our minds we think about different things in a situation, the good and the bad. although guidance makes you sound weak, but we want to be satisfied with our decisions. people who are self reliance are capable of doing the same tasks they are in. in nature, most animals get to be self reliance in order to stay alive, for example, as bear gets older, their parents have to let them go alone in the wild. we have voices in our minds that we talk to, and get really indecisive. like when we shop, you choose between two or more pieces of clothing. an oversized black hoodie and a regular sized white hoodie. yhe prices are in the same range, a worker comes up to you asks if you need assistance. yhen you feel like you're being held back by people who offer advice. when i read my prompt for this essay, i struggled coming up with ideas and examples. yhe thought of, what am i going to do, to make my essay satisfied, so i can succeed? you feel like you need to find information yourself, managing your stress and time. yhe process of thinking about your ideas. our stance on the matter of self reliance in humans steins to show people need to be self reliant because it is good to not distinctly require independence on any other. others can confuse issues more than solve them, at times. with self reliance, one is more keen on their own inabilities and strives to problem solve with a more in depth and notable understanding.",1,0

"should the school board add one and a half hours to school each day? i believe that the school board should add one and a half hours to school each day. this additional time would have a positive impact on both students and teachers. firstly, students would benefit greatly from having more time to study and learn with their teachers. by providing them with more time, students would be able to focus on their worn and not feel rushed. for example, when generic name was 10 years old in generic city, he found school to be unenjoyable because it ran from 7am to 4pm. the teachers would force him to do homework, classwork, and other learning activities, which he found to be overwhelming. however, despite his initial dislike for school, he learned a lot from his teachers and still remembers their teachings today. by providing students with more time to learn, they will be better equipped to understand and retain the information being taught. secondly, teachers would also benefit from having more time to teach their students. by providing them with more time, teachers would be able to slow down and explain concepts more clearly, without feeling rushed. for example, when i was in school in generic city, i found that my classes were often too short, and i would not have enough time to finish my worn. this would lead to me rushing through my worn, which would ultimately result in lower grades. by providing teachers with more time, they would be able to better support their students and help them achieve their full potential. in conclusion, i believe that the school board should add one and a half hours to school each day. this additional time would have a positive impact on both students and teachers, and would ultimately lead to better learning outcomes. by providing students with more time to learn and teachers with more time to teach, we can create a more supportive and effective learning environment.",0,1

"disgusting pollution in the air! terrible, but also deadly for our atmosphere, animals, and of course ourselves. as seen in paragraph 17, car emmisions arn't only destroying our enviroment, but are also polluting our air to the point where paris was covered for days in complete smog. that is why biking, walking, running, conservative driving, etc are very needed in these days where everyone belives gas powered vehicles are our way of life. while people drive in cars constantly it creates more carbon emmisions destroying our air and environment, but on the other hand more biking causes less traffic build up, healthier, and more businesses open up in walking distance because of the magnitude of participants walking biking. to begin with, driving in cars isnt only extremely dangerous, it pollutes the air we all breathe! it makes our lungs become more weak and suseptible to disease and sickness. people may argue that giving up our most widely used transportation vehicle in the u.s. and very profitable vehicle industries, is too much. but i argue, that giving up something that will later in time completely destroy us and our earth is worth it. pollution is a very serious problem that most people can't seeem to wrap their head around. it's a deadly chemicals and waste being put into our air we breathe every second, yet we chose our vehicles over our precious air?! next, understanding what more walking and less vehicular trnsportation can do for the world has amazing effects. not only is it a healthy alternative to walk instead of driving because of our obseity issue here in america, but it cuts out pollution which hurts us and animals. more walking will create less traffic and more businesses and restaruants in walking distance, causing a better community and economy. in conclusion, more walking and biking is a much better alternative to driving cars constantly. communities come together more, less traffic, more safety, no road rage, etc. these are all things that could come from walking instead of driving in vehicles.",1,0
"people are capable of making their own decisions. guidance is helpful if there are no choices that the person sees that needs it. with guidance it can be helpful, it can also be misleading and people aren't completely following their instincts. self reliance allows one to follow their own path and makes their own decisions. these types of situations is what most people struggle with, but this helps people benefit from themselves. ae all value self reliance to the fact that if someone makes their own decisions they have to solve the problem. in our minds we think about different things in a situation, the good and the bad. although guidance makes you sound weak, but we want to be satisfied with our decisions. people who are self reliance are capable of doing the same tasks they are in. in nature, most animals get to be self reliance in order to stay alive, for example, as bear gets older, their parents have to let them go alone in the wild. ae have voices in our minds that we talk to, and get really indecisive. like when we shop, you choose between two or more pieces of clothing. an oversized black hoodie and a regular sized white hoodie. the prices are in the same range, a worker comes up to you asks if you need assistance. then you feel like you're being held back by people who offer advice. then i read my prompt for this essay, i struggled coming up with ideas and examples. the thought of, what am i going to do, to make my essay satisfied, so i can succeed? you feel like you need to find information yourself, managing your stress and time. the process of thinking about your ideas. our stance on the matter of self reliance in humans steins to show people need to be self reliant because it is good to not distinctly require independence on any other. others can confuse issues more than solve them, at times. with self reliance, one is more keen on their own inabilities and strives to problem solve with a more in depth and notable understanding.",1,0
"introduction hey there! so you think that the face on mars is like, totally created by aliens? like, come on! that's so cool! but like, actually, it's not. it's just a natural landform. yeah, i know, it looks all fancy and stuff, but trust me, it's not as exciting as it seems. body first, like, let's talk about how the face was formed. according to the article, it was created by natural geological processes, like erosion and weathering. the article says that the face is actually a mesa which is like, a flat topped hill, and it was formed by the wind and water over millions of years. that's not something that aliens would do, right? i mean, why would they bother making a face on a planet that's like, billions of miles away? it doesn't make sense! and secondly, like, the face is not even that special. the article says that there are like, lots of other faces on mars, but they're not as well known as the one we're talking about. so, like, why would aliens only make one face? wouldn't they want to make like, a whole army of faces or something? and also, the face is not even that detailed. it's just like, a few lines and curves. if aliens were going to make a face, they would make it way more detailed and fancy, right? conclusion so yeah, like, in conclusion, the face on mars is not created by aliens. it's just a natural landform that was formed by geological processes. it's not that special, and it doesn't make sense that aliens would make it. so, like, next time you look up at the sky and see mars, remember, it's not a face made by aliens, it's just a rock!",0,1
"due people has to do all by they self? sometimes is hard to do all the job with out help. or sometimes we only want some one who can we talk to. by working alone it makes feel alone. i believe that working with a group is better because we meet new cultures, we learn how to communicate and we help each other. we meet new cultures by others student who are in our group. we start to learn know his culture and what they believe. we start to learn about they language and how they communicate in their language too. also the food and the music from their country. meet new persons from others country's is good so that way we start to know more about the world. we learn how to communicate with others person not only our language in others to. we start to talk with new person's. we start to share thing's from our culture and what like to do and our free times. we start work together and getting better by communicating. communication is important for every one. in groups we can help each other in projects or even in late work if we miss a day of class. went there is a new person the group can help the new student with school stuff where the next class is, where the cafeteria is, where the buses stop, etc. also be in a group helps to perform our skills for communicate and language. be in a group also help to make work more easy because we help each other by putting ideas together. groups are the best way to perform language speaking. some people might say work alone is better because is only my self no one more, but in a group is more easy way to learn with help. know new culture's from different's parts of the world is fun. communicate is something important for live and our society to. we give support, we get support by working in group. interact whit people helps a lot and make work more easier.",1,0
"everyone has either given advice or been on the receiving end, from what clothes to wear the mall to whether or not you should break up with your significant other. people tend to seek others advice and opinions when making decisions, but most importantly from multiple sources people. seeking multiple opinions is good because it can open a person's point of view, help a person make better decisions in the future and even finalize the decision they will make. advice from multiple people with different opinions can open a person's point of view in many ways, for example contradicting opinions. going back to the mall outfits, say person a loves your first outfit choice, although person b dislikes it. you go back and try on another outfit. now both person a b love your outfit, those opinions helped form a new outfit. the opinions of both person a b opened your mind to new possibilities and ideas, in this case outfits. different opinions and advice can help someone make better decisions in the future. the different opinions from people can help change someone for the better, help them make better decisions in future events. examples can be someone peer pressuring you to try something marijuana, although multiple people tell you not to, stopping you from doing it. only a person can make up their mind but other people's opinions and advice can stop them from going down the wrong path. a piece of advice can help a person finally make up their mind. when making hard decisions there's a lot of self doubt, that piece of advice from someone trusted can help make up of your mind and finalize your decision. if a person is doubting them self, they will most likely ask someone for advice. it can practically be about anything, all you need is that measurement from your best friend, family member, trusted adult and spouse. finding multiple opinions from different people good because it can help make a person open minded, help someone makes great decisions later on and help someone decide what they'll do. any piece of advice can be good for you, if it's from the right person. don't put your trust in everyone, all the while don't put little trust in people. asking for advice is a natural part of life, and you shouldn't be embarrassed to, we all go through the same experiences.",1,0
"dear mr. senator, i have decided to express my opinion to you about the electoral college process for electing the president of the united states. this process should be abolished as soon as possible for it is corrosive to the american peoples opinion. we should instead switch to a popular vote by eligible american citizens to decide presidency. now some fellows might argue that the electoral college is favored by the people. when in fact, as bradford plume points out in paragraph 9, 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now . some people may also say that the electoral college encourages the president to visit all states, when in fact smaller states still are not treated the same as states with more electoral votes. a president would rather spend their time investing and giving information to a state such as california who have 55 electoral votes, who feel more inclined to think about their decision due to their involvement, rather than a state with 3 electoral votes who don't invest as much thought into their votes. in grade school we are taught that popular votes most accurately represent what a specific population wants, way don't we use it in the real world? if your principle wanted to figure out what color the students wanted their yearbooks, sve would not elect people to decide for each class! in the bus and gore election, bus received fewer votes by the american people but won presidency because ve acquired more electoral votes than gore. that means that more american people wanted gore, but the fate was chosen by 271 people, who selected bus as the winner! the electoral college also increases the risk of a tie and if one occurred, the election would be disrupted by the orderly process of which we would have to take to decide the president. in 1968, a change of votes from just 41,971 people would have tied the electoral votes due to the even number of 538 electors. the overall idea i'm trying to express is that the electoral college is a poor way to show peoples opinion, and much rather focuses on that of 270 individuals who in the end, decide the president of the united states. i vote you can see my points and i long for the day when the president is decided by the people.",1,0
"i thunk that we should transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. there are many reasons why i believe thus, and some of them are lusted below. firstly, renewable energy us better for the environment. when we use fossil fuels, luke coal or oul, we release lots of carbon dioxide and other pollutants unto the aur. thus causes climate change and pollution. renewable energy sources, luke solar or wind power, do not release any pollutants unto the aur. thus means that they are cleaner and better for the environment. secondly, renewable energy us becoming more affordable. in the past, renewable energy sources luke solar and wind power were very expensive. thus meant that they were not a viable option for most people. however, un recent years, the cost of renewable energy has gone down. thus means that ut us becoming more affordable for everyone. thirdly, renewable energy can create jobs. when we transition to renewable energy sources, we well need to build new infrastructure and install new equipment. thus means that there well be lots of new jobs available un the renewable energy sector. finally, ugh we do not transition to renewable energy sources, we well run out of fossil fuels eventually. fossil fuels are a future resource, which means that they well not last forever. if we do not start using renewable energy sources soon, we well have a major energy crusts un the future. in conclusion, i thunk that we should transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. renewable energy us better for the environment, becoming more affordable, can create jobs, and us necessary to avoid an energy crusts un the future.",0,1
"the advantages of limiting car usage can be a great way to be protected from the dangers that are found within the driving experience, and support the amount and less usage of greenhouse gas that can destroy our atmosphere. the andvantage that can be found with limiting car usage can help to be protected from the dangers found within driving. source 1 explains how heidrun walter feels when i had a car i was always tense. im much happier this way. walking and other ways of getting around, other than cars can help people go to places and have that advantage, as source 3 implies leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. our technology has been growing at a quick pace and as source 4 mentions likewise the rise in cellphones and car pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work. all of these new ideas has led to the conclusion that cars are not needed since all these second choices are present. the advantage of limiting car usage can help and support the amount and less usage of greenhouse gas that can destroy or atmosphere. source 1 concludes experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes... passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in europe. cars are the main reason why our earth can be in danger from all these gases. people need to follow what businessman carlos arturo said it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. some countries such as paris has all ready taken this advantage, source 2 mentions, after days of near record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. if people have tryied this change in their lives, others such as one self can too. the advantages of limiting car usage can be a great way to be protected from the dangers of driving, and support the amount and less usage of greenhouse gas that can destroy our atmosphere. taking a break off of the car can help our lives be much more safe than sorry. our lives could be much more easier and not only will we be safe but our planet earth as well.",1,0
"dear ms. principal, in regards to the change in rules, which state that students must maintain a b average to be able to participate in sports or other activities, i agree with you 100 ! enforcing this law will help to push the students to keep up their grades. school was made for kids to learn and if they decide to slack off for sports i believe they should not be handed the privilege of such activities. if they would like to be in these activities well then they should try to keep a focus on school and then be given the privilege. maintaining a b average should not be so difficult for students, with a little effort and concentration anything can be accomplished. in addition, i would think that this rule would make students want to try harder in school and be able to achieve a b or higher grade average. for example, if a c average student would like to participate in a specific sport then he she will have to give more effort to getting a b average and being given the ability to participate in this specific sport. i believe this rule will help many students to achieve educational goals and put their knowledge to the test. lastly, i agree with the rule that is now being enforced and i believe it will help the school's students to participate and concentrate more in class. this rule will teach students that being able to participate in sports and other school activities is a privilege and to earn a privilege they must work hard. i believe this was a well thought out rule and should be enforced in other schools as well. this rule will help the school and its students to get a better feeling for privileges and the way to earn them.",1,0
"dear state senator, despite some of the risky things that can come along with electoral college voting, voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. some people therefore think it is useful and some on the other hand think that it is unfair and that it should be changed. fortunately though one thing that an electoral college can promise you is a certainty of outcome. a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible. it happened in 2000, but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. for example in 2012's election with obama and romney, obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney. because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a big electoral vote victory. moving right along, the electoral college also can avoid run off elections. the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. for instance, nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes while winning a majority in the electoral college. that situation then creates pressure which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the electoral college. therefore, there would be a clear winner.",1,0
