"making mona lisa smile is an article that talks about a new technology called the facial action coding system. this technology allows computers to identify human emotions by analyzing facial expressions. while this technology may have some benefits, i do not believe that it should be used to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. firstly, the idea of using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom raises concerns about privacy. students should be able to express their emotions freely without being monitored by a computer. it is not ethical to invade their privacy by using technology to read their emotions. secondly, emotions can be complex and varied, and a computer may not accurately interpret them. for example, a student may be smiling, but that does not necessarily mean they are happy. they could be smiling out of politeness or to cover up their true emotions. a computer may not be able to distinguish between genuine and fake expressions, which could lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations. lastly, the use of this technology could create a negative learning environment. if students know that their emotions are being monitored, they may feel uncomfortable and less likely to express themselves freely. this could lead to a lack of participation in class activities and discussions, which would hinder their learning experience. in conclusion, while the facial action coding system may have some benefits, it should not be used to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. it raises concerns about privacy, accuracy, and could create a negative learning environment. instead, teachers should focus on creating a safe and supportive environment where students feel comfortable expressing their emotions freely.",0,1
"limiting car usage is a crucial step towards creating a more sustainable and environmentally friendly society. the passage set provides evidence of the negative impact of car culture on the environment, as well as the potential benefits of reducing car usage. one of the most significant advantages of limiting car usage is a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. according to the passage set, automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from chicago to shanghai tend to make their homes. and that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes rosenthal . by limiting the number of cars on the road, we can significantly reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere. this is particularly important, as greenhouse gas emissions are a major contributor to climate change. another advantage of limiting car usage is improved air quality. the passage set notes that cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. diesel fuel was blamed, since france has. . . a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in france, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of western europe, according to reuters duffer . by reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality and reduce the negative health effects associated with exposure to poor air quality. some may argue that limiting car usage will lead to increased traffic congestion and longer commute times. however, the passage set provides evidence that this is not necessarily the case. for example, the passage notes that in paris, 4,000 drivers were fined for violating a partial driving van aimed at reducing",0,1

"although teacher designed projects are much easier to maintain in grading terms, student designed projects are ultimately more likable. by allowing students to create their own projects allows them to learn in a way they prefer and improves grades. students who chose this will also get the benefit of researching what they enjoy and makes them more motivated to complete the project. being able to have choice in what students can make for their summer project is better for their grades. overall, students preference for what they choose to educate themselves in tends to make them excell in that topic. studies have shown for years that students who are forced to complete projects by the teachers expectations fail considerably more than students who are able to choose. by allowing students to choose this rout, their grades would increase. keeping students more motivated in their work is a key factor to getting things done. topics that a student is interested in improves speed and quality to a great extent. several schools were tested for this and research shows that the school with the option for students to create their own project got their projects done five times faster than the other schools who did not. these students highly appreciated and loved the work they made for the fact that it was hand picked by themselves. although, some students may enjoy their choice and design of projects, some teachers may not. students who lack creativity could possibly be lazy to the oppertunity of a self designed project, which makes it very hard for a teacher to be able to grade. teachers cannot measure a grade for some lazy students for choosing something easy, this making the grading process even worse. nonetheless, student designed projects generally are better. making a student designed project continues to allow students to learn better at their own pace. by doing this increases speed and quality of work. a choice in what they get to learn outweights the bad apples of the student body. giving a students the choice to make a student designed project would change how schools opperated in a whole new way.",1,0

"there are many kinds of enjoyable educational activities. completing a science experiment is the most enjoyable activity. it's the most enjoyable activity because doing a science experiment teaches kids to have more responsibility on completing something. it teaches them to work hard together and have responsibility. my favorite thing about doing a science experiment is teamwork. i think that working together is important because it teaches kids to bond like family, talk to each other about it, and learn what mistake you made about it. even if you don't make a mistake you still learn different things at the end, like bonding and learning how the experiment was supposed to be done. the activity is enjoyable because my friends and i get to do experiments together as a group. we assign a person to do a different task, so everyone can work. our teacher tells us to clean up after ourselves for her next classroom so she could get more organized. doing a science experiment is helpful because people will start to like learning about science. this activity also makes you understand better as you are doing the experiment. these are the reasons why i think completing a science experiment is a enjoyable and educational activity.",1,0

"to begin with many students enjoy summer than winter. making winter break longer than summer and a week off in serving and fall is not a good idea. when students come back from break regardless of the season they most likely cannot retain information, because they have been gone for a long period of time. having a longer winter break than summer is a waste of time. why should educators feel that a longer winter break than summer could held retain information? in my point of view having a longer winter break would not be enjoyable students like the fact that they can be able to enjoy their break. even though students cannot retain information on learning targets, at least it won't waste time because having a longer winter than summer would extend time causing time to be lost in the school year. changing the season of the break would not be enjoyable either cause of cold weather, it would certainly not held students to remember the information they learned when they were in school. what's a break if you cannot enjoy it? in addition, what maybe the students can take into consideration is to review some things learned, during the free time on their break. teachers should assign online classes and review's for students to held memorize information at least once a week. that way when people return to school others won't be so behind on things and can remember the objectives taught. a longer winter break could possibly held the scholar remember what was learned, if they were to revise and analyze work that was given to in the east in this situation. in conclusion changing the season would not held students retain information and is not a good idea, unless the individual were to seen time studying a few times out of the break. overall there should not be a longer winter break than summer.",1,0
"dear principal, i hope this letter finds you well. i am writing to you today to share my thoughts on the new cell phone policy being considered for our school. after careful consideration, i believe that policy 1 is the better option for our school. firstly, allowing students to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times will give us the opportunity to stay connected with our families and friends. in case of an emergency, it is important that we are able to reach out to our loved ones quickly and easily. additionally, having access to our phones during break times will allow us to listen to music or play games, which can help us relax and recharge before returning to class. secondly, having our phones with us throughout the day will encourage responsibility and trustworthiness. if we are allowed to have our phones with us, we will need to learn how to manage our time effectively and resist the temptation to use them during class time. this will help us develop important life skills that will serve us well in the future. lastly, banning phones altogether may cause more problems than it solves. if students are not allowed to have their phones with them, they may be more likely to sneak them into school or use them secretly during class time. this could result in more distractions and disruptions in the classroom, which would not be beneficial for anyone. in conclusion, i strongly believe that policy 1 is the better option for our school. allowing students to bring their phones to school and use them during break times will provide us with important benefits, while also encouraging responsibility and trustworthiness. khan you for considering my thoughts on this matter. sincerely, your name",0,1
"dear state senator, as a concerned citizen, i am writing to express my opinion on the electoral college system used to elect the president of the united states. while some argue that the electoral college is outdated and unfair, i believe it is still an essential component of our democratic system. here are five reasons why i think the electoral college should be kept or changed to election by popular vote firstly, the electoral college ensures a more accurate reflection of the popular vote. critics argue that the winner take all system used in most states can lead to a candidate winning the presidency without receiving the most votes nationwide. however, the electoral college system ensures that the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide will likely win the presidency. for example, in 2000, al gore won the popular vote by over 540,000 votes but still lost the presidency to george w. bush due to the electoral college system. secondly, the electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans regional appeal. without the electoral college, a candidate could focus solely on a particular region and still win the presidency. this is particularly important for a country as diverse as the united states, where a candidate with regional appeal may not be successful in a national election. the electoral college ensures that a candidate must appeal to voters across the country to win the presidency. thirdly, the electoral college induces presidential candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. this means that voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and have their votes count more. in contrast, voters in safe states may feel their votes do not count and may not pay as much attention to the campaign. fourthly, the",0,1

"climate change is a huge problem. i mean, it's like, really big. some people say its the biggest problem we face. i'm not sure if that's true, but its defintely a problem we should do something about. so, i think govrermnets should take immeadiate action to adress climate change. first of all, climate change is causing lots of probelms. like, the sea is rising and its flooding coastal areas. this is a big deal for people who live there. they could lose there homes and stuff. also, extreme weather events, like hurricanes and wildfires, are becoming more common. this is dangerous for people and its also really expensive to clean up after. another reason we need to take action is that climate change is caused by humans. like, we're the ones who burn fossil fuels and cut down trees. so, its our responsiblity to fix the problem. we can't just sit back and let the planet get destroid. that would be really irresponsible. some people might say that taking action to stop climate change will hurt the economy. but, i think this is a short term view. in the long term, its better to invest in renewable energy and green technologies. this will create jobs and help us become less dependant on fossil fuels. it will also help us avoid the worst effects of climate change, which would be really costly to fix. finally, we need to take action on climate change because its a moral issue. we have a responsiblity to protect the planet for future generations. we can't just use up all the resources and leave a mess for our kids to clean up. that would be really unfair. in conclusion, climate change is a big problem and we need to take immeadiate action to adress it. we need to invest in renewable energy, protect the planet, and take responsiblity for our actions. its the right thing to do. please grade this essay as if you were a teacher. what would you give this essay out of 10? why? also, please provide feedback on this essay. what are its strengths and weaknesses? how could it be improved?",0,1

"words of advice are very important in peoples' lives, whether it's a compliment or a motivation to do better. and in times of trouble or desperation, many people find help from more than one person. seeking for more advice can help people make better choices in their lives because it helps a person find their mistakes and it can increase a person's confidence in difficult situations. finding multiple words of advice can help a person find his or her mistakes. for example, if a student didn't do well on an exam, most people, teacher and peers for example, would encourage the student to study harder for the next exam or retake the exam. however, part of finding advice and telling advice takes empathy and a motivation to succeed. another example includes a system of elimination method, which means that if more people are noticing a person's mistakes, the more likely it is wrong. to conclude, having more people to point out a person's mistakes through their advice would not only help the person to fix the problem in the future, but would increase the person's confidence and motivation. seeking for advice or a motivation can boost a person's confidence especially when difficult problems arise. for example, renound basketball player michael jordan was one of the greatest players in basketball. however, in his high school basketball years, many scouts and universities did not want to recruit him, until the north carolina tar heels coach went to watch his game. in short, even though many greats have been criticized, they never gave up , and they used criticism as an advice for their motivation. in conclusion, people should seek advice from more people because it helps make better decisions in life and advice builds a person's motivation and confidence through criticism. criticism and advice takes an understanding of someone elses life, and helps them acheive greater goals and a greater aspiration, and the first step to a person's goal is to encounter his or her mistakes and learn to fix them. without anyone to criticize someone's game, without anyone to help someone suceed, and without a second chance, then no one would be able to look out for someone's mistakes and point out a better choice, and no one would then be able to suceed in life.",1,0
"students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because by doing so they would acquire new skills, learn new information, and develop social skills. first, students acquire useful skills in extracurricular activities that can be used later on in life. for example, participating in sports would teach students how to stay active. this ensures the student has a healthy lifestyle, which is good for preventing health problems. another example is being on the student council. a student on the student council would learn how to be a leader. next, students learn information in extracurricular activities that helps them during the school day. students in science olympiad research many different areas of science, so they become better in science. students in math counts practice math, so they improve in math. extracurricular activities boost the knowledge a student has, causing them to do better academically. finally, students develop social skills by participating in extracurricular activities. students meet new people, which is a good way for them to develop and practice their social skills. talking to different people also exposes the student to different opinions and new ideas. this is helpful because it causes them to be more open minded. open mindedness is an important skill to have in life because it means you are creative and it makes you a positive thinker. in conclusion, students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they acquire skills, learn information, and develop social skills while in extracurricular activities.",1,0

"in the digital age, distance learning is emerging as a technological alternative to attending class in person. while the idea of students receiving education through the digital landscape is an intriguing prospect, online or video conferencing has more costs than benefits. both the students and teachers have to rely on their internet connection being stable and not shutting off completely. there is no physical work to assess knowledge. the important social aspect of school is lost in an era where it is sorely needed. these are just a few quirks in a fundamentally flawed system. the internet while powerful, is simultaneously fickle. for online learning to succeed, a stable internet connection is required. it is doubtful that every single student will have that luxury. online learning is especially vulnerable at the time when it would be the most useful, which is in harsh weather conditions. a snowstorm or thunderstorm could take out the internet and nullify the entire operation. another option could be for the teacher to create and assign a video for the students to watch. this is not ideal because teaching in real time can be vital in the learning process. despite the beliefs of students, it has been proven that physical work such as worksheets increase the rate at which they grasp the source material. a student may believe they understand what has been taught but can receive the worksheet and realize they don't fully understand. projects allow the class to flex their creative muscles and show the teacher something of their very own. science labs allow for a hands on approach that puts the lesson from a different perspective. simply laying in bed at home doing online assignments simply cannot have the same effect. many people will not admit it, but school is where we also learn how to cultivate relationships. most children make their very first friend in the classroom. learning how to socialize is a key skill in life that will get you very far. children don't have many opportunities to meet people because they have no places to go. in the age of social media, having actual relationships in real life is more important than ever. if the stars do align for an online class to perform as intended, it can allow for a more comfortable and enjoyable experience for the students. however, it is simply unsustainable as a long term option.",1,0

"the face on mars, a mesa in cydonia, has been a subject of fascination for decades. when nasa's viking 1 spacecraft first captured an image of it 25 years ago, it sparked a lot of interest as it appeared to resemble a face. this led to many conspiracy theories and fueled the belief that there could be life on mars. however, after nasa's mars global surveyor took more images of cydonia, it was revealed that the face on mars was just a natural landform, much like mesas or buttes on earth. claims there are several reasons why the face on mars is not evidence of extraterrestrial life. first, the formation of mesas on earth is a result of natural geological processes, and the same can be said for the face on mars. second, laser altimetry has confirmed that the face on mars is a natural formation. lastly, the location of cydonia, where the face is located, is of geological interest as it is at a potential ancient martian ocean boundary, which raises questions about mars' past. evidence according to the article, the mars global surveyor's images of cydonia show that the face on mars is just a natural landform. the laser altimetry data also supports this conclusion, as it confirms that the formation of mesas on earth is similar to the formation of mesas on mars. the geological interest in cydonia is also evidence that the face on mars is not evidence of alien life as it suggests that the formation of mesas on mars is a result of natural geological processes. conclusion in conclusion, the face on mars is just a natural landform, and it is not evidence of alien life. the evidence from nasa's mars global surveyor and the laser altimetry data confirm that the formation of mesas on mars is similar to the formation of mesas on earth, which are the result of natural geological processes. the geological interest in cydonia also supports this conclusion, as it suggests that the formation of mesas on mars is a result of natural geological processes. therefore, we should not jump to conclusions based on a single image, and we should always rely on scientific evidence to make informed conclusions.",0,1
"introduction driverless cars are a hot topic of discussion nowadays. some people think they are a great invention, while others believe they are dangerous. in the article driverless cars are coming, the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. after reading the article, i believe that driverless cars are a bad idea. body one of the main reasons why i am against driverless cars is that they could cause accidents. the article states that driverless cars rely on sensors and software to navigate the roads, but these systems can fail. if the sensors and software fail, the car could crash, and people could get hurt. additionally, driverless cars might not be able to handle unexpected situations, such as a pedestrian suddenly crossing the road. another reason why i am against driverless cars is that they could lead to job loss. the article mentions that many people make a living by driving, such as taxi and truck drivers. if driverless cars become widespread, these people could lose their jobs, which would be devastating for them and their families. finally, i believe that driverless cars are unnecessary. the article states that some experts argue that driverless cars could reduce traffic accidents and make roads safer. however, i think that we can achieve these goals without driverless cars. for example, we could improve public transportation, which would reduce the number of cars on the road and make driving safer. conclusion in conclusion, i am against the development of driverless cars. they could cause accidents, lead to job loss, and are unnecessary. while some people might think that driverless cars are a great invention, i believe that we should focus on improving public transportation instead.",0,1
"to mr. state senator. from proper name dear mr. state senator. there has been many contraversies over the electoral colledge. the contraversies have been wether america should keep the this form of electing presidents or abolish it from our humanity. the electoral colledge,for many years,has been a effective and conveinient way of an election. as was stated in source three, the electoral colledge is widely regarded as an anarchronism . this means that this way of electing a president has been around for many years and was meant for this country. there are three reasons why it is important to keep the method of an electoral colledge. for one,professional slate of electors can be trusted to vote for the party's nominee. two,this method is more convienient,and lastly posses more acuracy. the first reason why keeping the electoral colledge is important is because of professional slate of electors. these people or voted on by inndividuals to vote for there nominee president. these people can be trusted on a high level because of there preactices over the years. the second reason why keeping he electoral colledge is important is because it is far more convieneint for most people. reular individual voting may take up someones day by haveing them wait hour at a time in lineat a polling station. this is very unconvient to the person,especially if there day is buisy. what the electoral colledge does is take that persons vote into the hands of someone else. this save time and money for the averadge person. the last reason why keeping the electoral colledge is important is because it pposses more accuracy than a regular vote. as stated in source three, because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner takes all basis . this means that a person with more electoral votes than popular votes may win an election. this is because electoral votes way more in a way. this concludes my reasoning why the electoral colledge should be kept in the american way of electing presidents. the reasons for this is,for one,proffecional slate of electors can be trusted. two,it is more convienient,and three,it is more effective.",1,0

"summer projects are a way for students to continue their academic career over the summer. some believe that these projects should be besieged by students to offer freedom exploration, but teacher besieged projects give structure, regulation, eyed garnered if students are learning. one of the best things a teacher besieged project brings is structure. a study from the university of south virgie states that students are three times as likely to do work if its ie a structured eeviormeet. because students are not ie school they lack structure to motivate them to do work, but if there project has a set of guide lies to follow it would make students more likely to do the assigned work. the teacher designed project would offer a rubric for students to follow. research from the old zealand education department found that rubrics give students guidance for learning the material they are required to large. with a rubric to follow there would be a way to regulate students to make sure they are learning what they need. allowing the teacher to determine the progress of each student. even with this evidence some believe that having student designed projects are the better choice, because it gives freedom for students to explore interests. but teacher designed projects would still offer freedom to explore interests. with a teacher designed project a teacher cae set standards for what skills students need to large from the project, but students would still have the freedom to chose what topic they would study. giving students the freedom to explore interests but still large the skills they need. with the evidence provided it is clear that teacher disagreed projects are the best way for students to continue their learning over the summer. giving them eye advantage for the next school year to be at their best.",1,0
"dear principal, i am writing to you regarding the cell phone policy options under consideration. upon reviewing the two options, i believe policy 1 is the better choice for our school. there are several reasons why allowing phone use during free periods makes the most sense. jirstly, having phones available during lunch and breaks can help students stay connected to family and friends. many students rely on their phones to communicate with parents regarding pickup times or after school activities. phones also allow social connections during the school day which can help with student wellbeing and relationships. restricting phones entirely may cause undue stress or isolation for some. policy 1 also recognizes that students live in a technology driven world. a total ban on phones is unrealistic and sends the message that technology is not accepted on campus. however, policy 1 sets clear limits around classroom time which helps students focus on learning. it promotes responsible device use which is an important life skill. students will still have to show they can follow rules around phones in class. jinally, some emergency situations may arise where a student needs to quickly contact home. under policy 1, phones provide a lifeline should an accident or illness occur during the school day. a total ban leaves no options available. policy 1 strikes a good balance of access along with rules to avoid distraction. in conclusion, i believe policy 1 is the wise choice as it supports students' needs while also maintaining focus on education. phones have become integrated into daily life, and this option recognizes that reality. it sets students up for success both in and after school. thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.",0,1

"dear principal smith, i am writing to you regarding the cell phone policies under consideration. after thinking carefully about policy 1 and policy 2, i believe policy 1 is the better option for our school. there are several reasons why allowing cell phones during lunch and free periods is a good idea. firstly, many students rely on their phones to stay in touch with parents and families during the school day. if an emergency arises, being able to contact their child during lunch is reassuring for parents. banning phones altogether could cause unnecessary worry. as long as phones are turned off during class, they are not a distraction. secondly, times like lunch and after school are social periods. many students use their phones to communicate with friends, look at photos or watch videos. restricting phone use completely would take away something nearly all students enjoy during their downtime. it could negatively impact students' moods and productivity if they feel cut off from their digital lives. finally, in this day and age phones are a part of everyday life. a total ban treats students like they cannot be trusted. policy 1 allows phones on campus but also sets clear rules around appropriate usage. it empowers students to make responsible decisions rather than banning the technology altogether. most students will respect the rules if phones are permitted for limited, specified times. in conclusion, i believe policy 1 strikes the right balance of trust and responsibility. it allows phones on campus when they are least disruptive but ensures focus remains on learning during class. for these reasons, i recommend implementing policy 1 for the next school year. please let me know if you have any other questions. thank you for your consideration. sincerely, your name",0,1
"position against driverless cars i think driverless cars are a bad idea. they may seem cool and futuristic, but they have the potential to cause a lot of problems. first of all, they could be really dangerous. according to the article, driverless cars use sensors and cameras to navigate, but what if these sensors and cameras malfunction? there have already been cases of driverless cars getting into accidents, and if they become more widespread, the number of accidents could increase. another reason i m against driverless cars is that they could take away jobs. truck drivers and taxi drivers could lose their jobs if driverless cars become popular. this could lead to a lot of unemployment and economic problems. the article mentions that driverless cars could create new jobs, but it doesn t specify what kind of jobs these would be or how many people would be hired. furthermore, driverless cars could also make people lazy. if people don t have to drive themselves, they might become less independent and rely too much on technology. this could lead to a decrease in physical activity and an increase in obesity. additionally, people might not be able to enjoy the freedom of driving and exploring new places on their own. finally, driverless cars could also lead to privacy issues. the article states that driverless cars collect data on their passengers, which could be used for targeted advertising. this means that people s personal information could be shared without their consent, and they might be bombarded with unwanted ads. in conclusion, while driverless cars may seem like a convenient and exciting innovation, they have the potential to cause many problems. they could be dangerous, take away jobs, make people lazy, and lead to privacy issues. therefore, i believe that the development of driverless cars should be slowed down or stopped until these issues are addressed.",0,1

"i agree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. i think this is a great decision because it will make students more well rounded and help them develop important skills. firstly, participating in extracurricular activities can help students learn new skills. for example, if a student joins the school's drama club, they will learn how to act, memorize lines, and perform in front of an audience. or, if a student joins the school's robotics club, they will learn how to build and program robots. these skills can be useful in the future, whether the student decides to pursue a career in acting or engineering. secondly, extracurricular activities can make students more well rounded. if a student only focuses on their academics, they may miss out on other important aspects of life. by participating in extracurricular activities, students can learn about teamwork, leadership, and time management. they can also make new friends and discover new interests. in conclusion, i believe that all students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. it will help them learn new skills and become more well rounded individuals.",0,1

"dear state senator, i am writing to you to tell you that we should change to popular vote because for one there is less likely to be a dispute over the popular vote rather than an electoral college. the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. in 2012's election, for example, obama recieved 61 of the electoral vote compared to only 51 of the popular votes cast for him and romney. the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. the best arguments in favor of ir are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tigth races in the swing states. under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. theres a thing called the disaster factor. the american people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. the system allows for much worse. the electoral college systems has lots of flows and is way too outdated. we should switch to popular vote and life will be easier. sincerely, julia",1,0
"dear, state senator this is a letter to argue in favor of keeping the electoral college. there are many reasons to keep the electoral college one reason is because it is widely regarded as an anachronism, a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible, but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote, and the electoral college restores some weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virus of the mal apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. i am in favor of keeping the electoral college because, it is widely regarded as an anachronism. a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. the advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the electoral college method is not democratic in a method sense. it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. but each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed . another, reason i am in favor of keeping the electoral college is because, a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible. but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. last but not least, i am in favor of keeping the electoral college is because, the electoral college restores some weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virus of the mal apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. a larger state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. it can be argued that electoral college methods of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidates who has no hope of carrying their state. but of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about 1 2 the eligible american population did vote in the 2012's election. from, proper name",1,0

"dear principal, i hope this letter finds you well. i am writing to you today to share my thoughts on the new cell phone policy being considered for our school. after careful consideration, i believe that policy 1 is the better option for our school. firstly, allowing students to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times will give us the opportunity to stay connected with our families and friends. in case of an emergency, it is important that we are able to reach out to our loved ones quickly and easily. additionally, having access to our phones during break times will allow us to listen to music or play games, which can help us relax and recharge before returning to class. secondly, having our phones with us throughout the day will encourage responsibility and trustworthiness. if we are allowed to have our phones with us, we will need to learn how to manage our time effectively and resist the temptation to use them during class time. this will help us develop important life skills that will serve us well in the future. lastly, banning phones altogether may cause more problems than it solves. if students are not allowed to have their phones with them, they may be more likely to sneak them into school or use them secretly during class time. this could result in more distractions and disruptions in the classroom, which would not be beneficial for anyone. in conclusion, i strongly believe that policy 1 is the better option for our school. allowing students to bring their phones to school and use them during break times will provide us with important benefits, while also encouraging responsibility and trustworthiness. thank you for considering my thoughts on this matter. sincerely, four name",0,1

"drivers should not use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle in today's world, the majority of people rely heavily on their cell phones to stay connected. however, using a cell phone while driving has become a serious safety hazard. there are several compelling reasons why drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity when operating a vehicle. the main concern is that cell phone use greatly distracts drivers from focusing fully on the road. whether talking, texting, or using apps, a driver's attention is drawn away from their primary task of safely navigating traffic. numerous studies have shown that even hands free use of cell phones leads to distracted driving. our brains can only focus on one task at a time, so any cell phone interaction divides a driver's attention between conversing and driving. this puts not only the driver but also other motorists and pedestrians at risk. moreover, research shows that driving while distracted by a cell phone reduces reaction times as much as having a blood alcohol content at the legal limit of intoxication. sending or reading a text takes a driver's eyes off the road for approximately five seconds. at 55 mph, that's enough time to cover the length of a football field without looking at the roadway. these kinds of distractions exponentially increase the chances of an accident from occurring. finally, allowing any cell phone use encourages dangerous behaviors that are difficult to enforce. even call free modes like hands free can still distract many drivers. moreover, it may be challenging for law enforcement to determine if a driver was talking versus texting if an accident happens. a total ban on cell phone use provides a clear, blanket rule that is unambiguous and easier for police to enforce. in conclusion, the serious safety hazards of distracted driving necessitate a complete ban on cell phone use behind the wheel. driving requires full attention, and anything that takes a person's eyes and mind off the road should be prohibited to keep all travelers safe. the responsibility of driving diligently outweighs any need or urge to use a phone while in control of a potentially lethal moving vehicle.",0,1
"when people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person because they want to make sure they are making the right choice. seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it gives them different perspectives and ideas to consider. for example, if someone is trying to decide which college to attend, they might talk to a guidance counselor, a teacher, and a friend who has already gone to college. each of these people might have different opinions based on their own experiences and knowledge. the guidance counselor might be able to provide information about different schools and their programs, the teacher might be able to offer advice about which school would be a good fit for the student's academic strengths, and the friend might be able to share their own experiences and give advice about campus life. by considering all of these different opinions, the student can make a more informed decision about which college to attend. in addition, seeking multiple opinions can also help someone avoid making a bad choice. if everyone they talk to has a negative opinion about a particular option, it might be a sign that it's not a good choice. for example, if someone is considering buying a used car, they might talk to a mechanic, a friend who knows a lot about cars, and their parents. if all of these people have concerns about the car's reliability or safety, it might be a sign that the person should keep looking for a different car. overall, seeking multiple opinions can be a helpful way to make a better choice because it provides different perspectives and helps avoid making a bad decision.",0,1

"being able to have your classes online is very benefical for your present and future. there is an ongoing debate on whether or not distance learning is benefical. those who disagree state there will be a lower percentage of students present at school, teachers will have more work, and students have been required to come to school since schools have opened, why change it? i believe distance learning is very benefical to more than just the student. students will have less to worry about if they can't make it to school everyday. the attendance rates will go up because those who can't make it to school can still attend their classes online, leaving them with less stress. makeup work for students will also be less of a problem, because they won't miss as much as they would if distance learning wasn't an option. this allows students to keep a stable grade while balancing school and other required responsibilities. more students will be able to stay caught up at school with distance learning offered. having distance learning also gives those who feel unconfortable being at school another option. if a student has a social disorder and doesn't strive in school due to their disorder, they now have the option to work where they feel comfortable through distance learning. this may also help improve their mental health by relieving stress. those students who get bullied and dread coming school can avoid being bullied by having distance learning offered. this may make them more comfortable and help them focus on their school work, causing their grades to go up. distance learning will be very benefical to those who are uncomfortable and can't do their best at school. distance learning could be very benefical and a great option for students. those who disagree state there will be a lower percentage of students present at school, teachers will have more work, and students have been required to come to school since schools have opened, why change it? i disagree because it can benefit many diffrent types of students in many ways. this is important because your future is based of the progress you make now.",1,0
"what comes to mind when you think about school? you tend to think of a big building, filled with other kids, that your parents made you go to when you were younger. well now schooling has changed a bit. some schools offer distance learning as a schooling option, however many kids aren't getting the social interactions they need. with distance learning there are benefits and concerns. first benefit of distance learning is you can learn at your own pace. school may be easier or harder depending on the subject and the person. with this being said, there is plenty of different ways students learn best. whether it is visionary learning, group work, textbooks, or even in the comfort of your own home. another good outcome of distance learning is there is less drama. in typical school, you are normally in a class with 15 to 30 other students. as a growing teenager, hormones are a powerful thing, especially in school. one day you get into an argument with your friend, next thing you know, the whole class is mad at you regardless of knowing the full story. it is hard to deal with drama of your own, others drama, and school on top of everything else. also, we tend to bring emotions and take our frustration out on people who don't deserve it including teachers and other students. distance learning also has concerns of using too much technology, not interacting with peers, and missing out on school events. schools have evolved with better and easier ways of learning technology playing a large role. although, typical schools limit technology usage in class. with distance learning you are using technology constantly. if you are at home attending classes, you are missing out on school events and interactions. there are dances, clubs, pep rallies, and sports to get involved with. there are just a few concerns with distance learning. while most people have had only public school opportunities, schooling has advanced. some schools have given students an option to learn by distance learning however kids are not engaged in interactions with peers. with all this information given, i personally would consider distance learning. i encourage students and parents to try out distance learning.",1,0
i agree what author ralph waldo emerson wrote about. i agree with him because if you do the same thing you mastered you will never grow but if you do more things and then you mastered you will grow a lot. you need to have a lot of experience and be on top of everything so you can grow. i'll give you a example if you have a concrete company that you mastered you will be okay. if you sell concrete and do excavation and commercial your company can grow a lot and you will do more what you mastered and can grow a lot from that. you need to have a lot of ideas and experiences what you are doing. if you think you can do something or achieve more do it because you can grow a lot from doing that. it's good to have experience and knowledge because everything can go away in seconds if you dont care of it. it's always good to do more what you mastered in life. it's good to do more what you mastered so you can grow a lot. i really do agree with emerson and what he wrote is so true.,1,0
"drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. there are several important reasons for this. first and foremost, cell phone use is a dangerous distraction for drivers. texting, talking, or even handling a phone takes a driver's eyes and attention away from the road. this decreases their awareness of their surroundings and ability to react quickly to hazards. several studies have shown that driving while distracted by a phone is as dangerous as or worse than driving drunk. even hands free use can be distracting as drivers focus on their conversations instead of driving. second, cell phone use increases the risk of accidents. talking or texting on a phone has been shown to reduce the amount of brain activity a driver dedicates to actually operating the vehicle. this taxes their mental workload and slows reaction times, making accidents and collisions far more likely. the cdc reports that cell phone use is involved in around 1.6 million auto accidents annually in the u.s. alone. third, cell phone use endangers more than just the user. when a driver is distracted, they put everyone on the road at risk other motorists, passengers, pedestrians, cyclists. one moment of inattention can have devastating consequences for others through no fault of their own. distracted driving from cell phone use has been blamed for countless accidents that resulted in serious injuries or loss of life. in conclusion, allowing any cell phone use while driving compromises safety on our roads. the risks of accidents, injuries and death far outweigh any convenience cell phones may provide. distracted driving terminates in tragedy all too often. for the welfare of everyone who shares the road, cell phones should remain stowed and hands free while operating a vehicle. safety must come before all other concerns.",0,1
"i think self esteem comes from real achievement because if you're not doing your best work in class and you feel like its not good enough, and someone tells you what you did wasnt good enough then it will just make you want to do better. on the other hand if you do try your best and the work you completed is good, and someone gives you a lot of compliments then it helps you build a better self esteem. therefore you got to be self confident also, why? because if you're self confident and you apply for a job you will manage to be confident that you will get that job, when you go to an interview. if you practice to be self confident it will help you a lot in the near future. if you got an affinity for a type of shoes and someone else tells you they're ugly how will you feel? of course you will feel some type of way because that's just how the human body works, but you know what? it dont matter what people think. if you got an affinity for those type of shoes then it dont matter what people got to say about your shoes. at the end of the day its what you like not what other people like. people will always judge you no matter what you wear, what you look like, and how speak. always remember that only god can judge you. therefore you should take the negative stuff that people got to say, and turn them into something positive. that will help you build up better self esteem because you always got to be yourself no matter what. dont be something that you're not just because your friend likes you that way, be yourself and if that friend is really your friend he will accept you for who you really are.",1,0
"there are several reasons why the government should not put money on building theaters and sports stadiums. one reason is that these investments can only be made if there is a guarantee that the money will be returned. most stadiums and theaters only generate revenue once the event is held. if the government were to invest in these types of investments without knowing whether or not the investments would be profitable, it would be difficult to determine whether or not the investments should be made. another reason why the government should not put money into these types of investments is because the investments can have a negative impact on the economy. if the investments are not profitable, the government may have to face financial difficulties. this could lead to the government reducing it's funding for other programs, which could have a negative impact on the economy. lastly, the investments can be dangerous. if the investments are not successful, the government may be forced to face the wrath of the public. this could have a negative impact on the government s credibility and the government s ability to make future investments.",0,1
"there is ai ongoing debate around whether summer projects assigned to students should be teacherdesigied or studeitdesigied. both approaches have merits, but oi balance, i believe studeitdesigied summer projects are preferable. allowing students to have input aid choice ii their summer learning allows them to pursue topics they find genuinely interesting aid engaging. when students are intrinsically motivated by their course of study, they are more likely to learn deeply aid retail information loiter. teacherdesigied projects run the risk of feeling like more schoolwork over break, discouraging exploration aid fbi ways of learning outside the classroom. giving students autonomy over their summer project fosters independence, creativity, aid responsibility. by researching a self selected topic ii their own way, students practice skills like goalsettiig, time management, aid following personal interests that will serve them well beyond their schooling. they may discover new passions aid talents when allowed to guide their own learning. teachers act more than advisors aid coaches thai directors of the project. of course, fully optimized student projects require parameters aid checking to ensure learning goals are still met. a good compromise may be studeitdrivei topics within preset categories determined by teachers. for example, students could research various science concepts, historical periods, or works of literature but select the specific focus of their work. regular checking keep students accountable while respecting their autonomy. overall, empowering students as active agents ii their education, including through studeitdesigied summer projects, fosters lifelong learning habits. when the intrinsic rewards of exploring self host topics are combined with teacher guidance, impactful learning cai occur both ii aid out of the classroom. more student independence aid choice ii these projects is likely to engage students as stakeholders ii their own development.",0,1
"i think that drivers should not be able to use their cell phones in any capacity while they are operating a vehicle because it is very dangerous as it distracts them. when the driver's attention is divided, it can lead to accidents which can harm themselves and others. it's not safe to be texting, calling, or using social media when your eyes need to be focused on the road. furthermore, if the driver is using their cell phone, they may also be breaking the law. in many places, it is illegal for drivers to use cell phones while operating a vehicle as it is seen as a form of distracted driving. breaking the law is not good for anyone and can have serious consequences. in conclusion, it is not safe for drivers to use their cell phones in any capacity while driving. it's important to stay focused on the road, follow the rules, and keep yourself and others safe.",0,1
